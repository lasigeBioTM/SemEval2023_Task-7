Oxaliplatin/Trastuzumab	Intervention	1
Patients with HER2 positive breast cancer received treatment with oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 IV day 1 and trastuzumab 6 mg/kg (following 8 mg/kg loading dose during cycle 1). Cycles were repeated every 21 days. Oxaliplatin : Oxaliplatin will be administered at a dose of 130 mg/ m2 over 120 minutes on day 1 of each cycle, following standard antiemetic premedications. 21 day cycles. For the first cycle, trastuzumab will be administered before oxaliplatin; however for subsequent cycles, oxaliplatin will be infused prior to trastuzumab Trastuzumab : Trastuzumab will be administered as an 8 mg/kg loading dose by intravenous (IV) infusion over 90 minutes on day 1 of cycle 1. Subsequent doses will be administered as a 6 mg/kg IV dose over 30 minutes.	Intervention	2
