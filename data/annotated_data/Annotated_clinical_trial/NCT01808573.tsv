Centrally Assessed Progression Free Survival	Results	1
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Measured in Months, for Randomized Subjects of the Central Assessment. The time interval from the date of randomization until the first date on which recurrence, progression (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.1), or death due to any cause, is documented. For subjects without recurrence, progression or death, it is censored at the last valid tumor assessment. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Here, the time to event was reported as the restricted mean survival time. The restricted mean survival time was defined as the area under the curve of the survival function up to 24 months.
