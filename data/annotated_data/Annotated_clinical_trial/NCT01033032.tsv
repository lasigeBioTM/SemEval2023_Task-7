Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) of MTD/Phase II Patients	Results	1
Progression-free survival is measured from Day 1 of study drug administration to disease progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, or death on the study. Progression is defined in RECIST v1.1 as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. This outcome measure is reported for all patients treated at the same dose level and is not separated into Phase I and Phase II. The phase I and phase II results are not separated as the timing of enrollment (early in phase 1 or later phase II) is not relevant to the outcome measure.	Results	2
