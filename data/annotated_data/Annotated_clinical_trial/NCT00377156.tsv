Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Neurocognitive Progression as Measured by the Number of Participants With Cognitive Deterioration by 3 Months	Results	1
The primary endpoint was cognitive deterioration (progression), defined as a decline of greater than 1 SD from baseline on at least 1 of 7 cognitive tests (all tests are standardized based on published norms and transformed so that higher values represent improved cognition) at the 3-month post-SRS evaluation. The number of participants who experienced cognitive deterioration by 3 months is reported for each arm below. For primary analysis of the 3-month cognitive deterioration endpoint, the Fisher exact 2-group binomial test was used to compare the proportion of evaluable patients with 3-month cognitive deterioration between the 2 groups.
