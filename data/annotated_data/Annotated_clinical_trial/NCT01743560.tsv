The best Overall Response (OR) for each patient is determined from the sequence of investigator overall lesion responses according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1.). To be assigned a best OR of Complete Responese (CR) at least two determinations of CR at least 4 weeks apart before progression are required. To be assigned a best OR of Partial Response (PR) at least two determinations of PR or better at least 4 weeks apart before progression (and not qualifying for a CR) are required.The Overall Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of patients with a best OR of confirmed CR or PR by week 48.
