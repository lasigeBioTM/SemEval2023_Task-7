irinotecan	CHEBI:80630	141-151
To establish the safety of escalating doses of MM-121 in combination with cetuximab or in combination with cetuximab and irinotecan in order to determine the recommended phase 2 dose.. Dose-escalation conducted using standard 3+3 model to determine maximum tolerated dose. Reports of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) were assessed to determine the MTD.	Results	2
