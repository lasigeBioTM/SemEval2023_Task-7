Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Objective Response Rate	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	19-23
The Objective Response Rate (Complete Response plus Partial Response, (CR + PR)) was defined as the proportion of participants who have a best overall response of confirmed CR or PR based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 as assessed by the Investigator. Tumor assessment was by computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To assess best response (CR, PR, stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), or not estimable (NE)), the Investigator selected up to five measurable target lesions (2 per organ). All other lesions were identified as nontarget lesions. Each participant's overall tumor burden at Baseline was compared with subsequent measurements of the target lesions. For participants with CR or PR, changes in tumor sizes had to be confirmed by repeat evaluations performed not fewer than four weeks after the initial response assessment.	Results	2
