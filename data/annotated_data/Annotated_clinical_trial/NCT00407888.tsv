Arm I	Intervention	1
Patients receive dose-intensive chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 10-15 minutes on day 1, oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-7, and filgrastim subcutaneously on days 2-7. Courses repeat every 7 days for up to 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 1 week later, patients then receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes once a week for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with HER-2/neu positive disease also receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes once a week for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.	Intervention	2
