Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression Free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of disease progression or death due to any cause. Disease progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or progression in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. The primary analysis of PFS was based on PFS events determined retrospectively by the central independent review committee, blinded to treatment assignment and investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.
