Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
The Intra-patient Changes of Weekly Hot Flash Activity From Baseline During the Treatment Period.	Results	1
The primary endpoint is the intra-patient changes of weekly hot flash activity from baseline during the treatment period. The hot flash activity will be measured by the weekly average hot flash score, which is a composite entity of both frequency and severity of hot flashes.	Results	2
frequency	HP:0040279	237-246
severity	HP:0012824	251-259
hot flashes	HP:0031217	263-274
The hot flash severity is graded from 1 to 4 (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, and 4=very severe). The daily hot flash score is computed by multiplying the mean grade of severity by the frequency during every 24 hour period. Therefore, a score of zero is the lowest possible score and can be interpreted as having no hot flashes. The weekly hot flash score was calculated by adding all scores for the week.	Results	3
