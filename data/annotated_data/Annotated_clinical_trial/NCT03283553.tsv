Between-group Differences in Patient Complete Illness Understanding at 9-months	Results	1
patient	HADO:0000008,OAE:0001817	29-36
Illness understanding was measured by 4 questions regarding knowledge that is considered to be essential to making informed treatment decisions in serious illness, including: 1.) understanding of illness, 2.) knowledge of disease status, 3.) awareness of disease state, and 4.) expectation of duration of life. We summed responses to each item (coded 1 or 0 to reflect the presence or absence of understanding), yielding a score ranging from 0 to 4. Participants with perfect scores reflecting complete illness understanding (4 of 4 correct responses) were compared to all others.	Results	2
