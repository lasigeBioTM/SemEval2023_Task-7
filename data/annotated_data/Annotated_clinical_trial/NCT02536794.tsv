INTERVENTION 1:	Intervention	0
Treatment (MEDI4736, Tremelimumab)	Intervention	1
Patients receive anti-B7H1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736 IV over 1 hour and tremelimumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Four weeks after the last combination dose, patients continue to receive anti-B7H1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736 every 2 weeks for up to 18 additional doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving PD or clinical benefit (CR, PR, or SD) may be retreated with anti-B7H1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736 for an additional 52 weeks.	Intervention	2
