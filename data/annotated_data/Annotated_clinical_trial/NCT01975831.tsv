Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of contraception from the time of screening and must have agreed to continue using such precautions for 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or for 6 months after the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab (whichever was longer).

A highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g., male or female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)	Results	1
Toxicity was graded in accordance with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03. Adverse events (AEs) were reported based on clinical laboratory tests, vital sign and weight measurements, physical examinations, performance status evaluations, electrocardiograms, magnetic resonance imaging, and any other medically indicated assessments, including subject interviews, from the time informed consent is signed through 90 days after the last dose of study treatment. AEs were considered to be treatment emergent (TEAE) if they occurred or worsened in severity after the first dose of study treatment.	Results	2
