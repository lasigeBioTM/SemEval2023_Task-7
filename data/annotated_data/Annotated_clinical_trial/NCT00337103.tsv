Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Overall Survival (OS)	Results	1
OS was measured from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, or the last date the participant was known to be alive. Participants who were lost to follow-up or who were alive at the date of data cutoff were censored. The censoring rules for OS were as follows: 1) if the participant was still alive at data cutoff, the date of data cutoff was considered the end date, and 2) if the participant was lost to follow-up before data cutoff, the date they were last known to be alive was considered the end date. Participants who survived past the end of the study were counted as in the full study period. If death occurred after data cutoff, the end date was to be censored at the time of data cutoff.
