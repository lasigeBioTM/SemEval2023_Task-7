Expression of ALDH1 and CD44v Change in the Binary Biomarkers From Baseline to 6 Weeks and 18 Weeks	Results	1
For biomarkers ALDH1 and CD44v, the change in the proportions of CD44v-positive (CD44v+) tumor cells and ALDH1-positive (ALDH1+) tumor cells in tumor tissue from baseline to 6 weeks and 18 weeks time points were determined for each patient. For biomarker change, changes in the binary biomarkers between time points were assessed using McNemar's test in all patients and separately in patients with and without pCR.	Results	2
