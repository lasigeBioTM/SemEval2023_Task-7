Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) in Participants With Any Solid Tumor (Phase Ib)	Results	1
mtd	BAO:0001248	24-27
Standard dose-confirmation design of 3 to 6 participants per cohort (3+3 design) was used to determine the MTD of eribulin in combination with cyclophosphamide for participants with any solid tumor. The highest dose level or MTD is reached when no more than one of six participants experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLTs). A DLT is defined as any treatment-related toxicity in first 28 days of therapy with a grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity, a grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting >7 days or febrile neutropenia, or any clinically significant toxicity grade 2 or higher that requires more than 14 days to resolve. The highest dose level at which no more than one of six participants experience DLT defines the MTD.	Results	2
