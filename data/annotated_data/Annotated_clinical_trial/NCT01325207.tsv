Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) of IT Trastuzumab in Sequential Cohorts of Escalating Doses for Patients With Leptomeningeal Metastases in HER2+ Breast Cancer.	Results	1
breast cancer	DOID:1612	154-167
Patients will be treated using a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design for cohorts 1 and 2. This will be followed by an accelerated phase I for cohorts 3 and 4, and then a standard 3 + 3 for the 5th cohort. In the accelerated phase (cohorts 3 and 4), 1 patient will be enrolled per cohort; if a toxicity is seen in that patient then the cohort would be expanded to 6 patients to allow for 1/6 patients per cohort to have a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) before dose escalation. Cohort 5 will enroll a total of 6 patients regardless of the toxicity experienced in patient one. However, if 2 or more DLTs are observed in cohort 5, cohort 4 will be reopened to enroll of a total of 6 patients. Whatever dose is ultimately declared the MTD should have 6 patients total. If 1/6 DLTs are seen in cohort 5 that will be considered the MTD.	Results	2
