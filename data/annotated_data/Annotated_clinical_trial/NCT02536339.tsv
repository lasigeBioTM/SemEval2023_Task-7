Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab	Intervention	1
Participants with CNS metastases secondary to HER2-positive MBC, who had disease progression in the brain following previous treatment with radiotherapy (whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery) for brain metastases, received treatment with pertuzumab in combination with high-dose trastuzumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurred first.

Percentage of Participants With Objective Response in the CNS, Assessed Using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology-Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) Criteria	Results	1
Responses were assessed by the investigator, based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, physical examinations, routine neurological examinations, and corticosteroid dosing. An objective response in the central nervous system (CNS) was a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed by repeat assessment, according to RANO-BM criteria. A CR was defined as the disappearance of all CNS target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; no corticosteroids; and stable or improved clinically; for non-target lesions, a CR was the disappearance of all enhancing CNS non-target lesions and no new CNS lesions. A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum longest diameter (LD) of CNS target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; stable to decreased corticosteroid dose; and stable or improved clinically. The 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence intervals were calculated for responses.	Results	2
