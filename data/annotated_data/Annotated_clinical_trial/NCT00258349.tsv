Response Rate	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	9-13
Tumor response is assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. Response included complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter.	Results	2
