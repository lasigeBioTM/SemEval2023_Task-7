Change in Ki-67 Levels From Baseline (Pre) to Day 28 (Post) Biopsy Samples	Results	1
day	UO:0000033	46-49
The primary endpoint is change in Ki-67 levels from baseline (pre) to day 28 (post) biopsy samples. Ki-67 levels were log-transformed to achieve approximately normally distributed data. The differences in these log-transformed values between post vs. pre biopsy samples were calculated. This difference represents the log of the ratio of post vs. pre Ki-67 levels in the original scale.	Results	2
