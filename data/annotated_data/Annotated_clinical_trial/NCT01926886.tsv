Trastuzumab	Intervention	1
Participants received trastuzumab IV infusion at initial loading dose of 8 mg/kg BW for q3w regimen as a part of neo adjuvant treatment before entering in the study and then recommended maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg BW q3w for the first 3 cycles (Cycles 7-9) in hospital followed by SC administration of trastuzumab at a fixed dose of 600 mg q3w for next 3 cycles (Cycles 10-12) at hospital and SC administration of trastuzumab at a fixed dose of 600 mg q3w at home for the next 6 cycles (Cycles 13-18) (Each cycle=21 days).

Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)	Results	1
An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. AEs included both serious and non- serious AEs. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. An emergent AE was defined as occurring within 35 days after last treatment administration.	Results	2
