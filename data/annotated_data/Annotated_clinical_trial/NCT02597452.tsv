intelligent Breast Exam, iBE: A bilateral iBE exam will be performed on the entire breast in addition to a clinical breast exam administered by a trained individual. If the patient is selected to participate in the inter-rater reliability portion of the study, the subject will undergo both the iBE and the clinical breast exams twice sequentially performed by two different separately trained individuals during the same visit.
