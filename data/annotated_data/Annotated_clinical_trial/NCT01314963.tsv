Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Relative Node Detection Sensitivity	Results	1
Relative node detection sensitivity (S) was defined as the proportion of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) that were identified with each instrument, with the proportion determined as the number of true positives (TP) divided by the total evaluated (N). The outcome result is expressed as the percentage for each device with 95% confidence intervals.	Results	2
