The outcome measures will be the severity of radiation dermatitis, using the Radiation Dermatitis Score (RDS), at the end of treatment in each treatment arm. (Objective: To examine the efficacy of curcumin in preventing and/or reducing the severity of dermatitis in radiation treatment site in breast cancer patients). The RDS score ranges from 0-4 with higher scores indicating worse outcome.	Results	2
