Objective Response Rate	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	19-23
The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on treatment based on RECIST1.1 criteria. For target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions. Confirmatory scans were required 3 weeks following initial documentation.	Results	2
