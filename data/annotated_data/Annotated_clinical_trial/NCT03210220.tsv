Ultrasound guided pectoral nerve block is performed right after induction, before surgery. The needle is advanced to the tissue plane between the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscle at the vicinity of the pectoral branch of the acromiothoracic artery, and 10 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine deposited. In a similar manner, 20 mL is deposited at the level of the third rib between the pectoralis minor muscle and the serratus anterior muscle .	Intervention	2
