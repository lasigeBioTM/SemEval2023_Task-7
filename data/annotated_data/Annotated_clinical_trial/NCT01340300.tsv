Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Change in Fasting Insulin Level	Results	1
insulin	CHEBI:145810	18-25
Determine whether supervised exercise training alone and metformin, either alone or in combination can decrease fasting insulin level from baseline to 3 months in patients who completed standard therapy for stage I-III colorectal or breast cancer. Fasting insulin levels in blood will be drawn at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Negative least square means indicate a decrease at 3 month comparing to baseline value.	Results	2
