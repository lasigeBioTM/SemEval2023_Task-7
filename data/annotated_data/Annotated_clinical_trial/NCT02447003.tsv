Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by Central Imaging Vendor (CIV) in All Cohort A Participants	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	19-23
central	HP:0030645	107-114
ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: 30% decrease in sum of diameters [SOD] of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 by CIV. ORR was estimated by Agresti-Coull (A-C) method. The percentage of participants who had CR or PR is reported here as the protocol-specified ORR, for the first pembrolizumab course, assessed from enrolment/treatment initiation and analyzed by Cohort, for all participants in Cohort A. Per protocol final ORR analysis in all Cohort A participants was done at the time of final statistical efficacy analysis, with a 10-November (Nov)-2017 cutoff. Per protocol ORR per RECIST 1.1 by CIV in all Cohort A participants was planned and conducted as a pre-specified primary outcome analysis. Per protocol ORR per RECIST 1.1 by CIV in all Cohort B participants was analyzed separately as a pre-specified secondary outcome analysis and reported later in the record.	Results	2
