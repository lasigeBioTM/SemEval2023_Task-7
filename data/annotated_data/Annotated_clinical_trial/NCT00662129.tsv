Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
6-month Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	40-44
The primary endpoint of this trial is the 6-month progression-free survival rate. A patient is considered to be a 6-month progression-free survivor if the patient is 6 months from registration without a documentation of disease progression (note, the patient need not be on study treatment at 6 months to be considered a success). The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated using the properties of the binomial distribution. Progression is defined using the RECIST Criteria, as at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, appearance of one or more new lesions, or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
