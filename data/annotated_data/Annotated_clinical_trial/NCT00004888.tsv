Grades of Cardiotoxicity Events in the Subset of Patients Reporting a Cardiotoxicity Event	Results	1
This table summarizes the cardiotoxicity events of different grades. Grade 1 is a decline of left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF) >=10% but <20% of baseline value. Grade 2 is LVEF below LLN (50%) or decline of LVEF >=20% of baseline value. Grade 3 is congestive heart failure responsive to treatment. Please note that only a subset of patients reported cardiotoxic events so the totals will not add up to the total number of participants.	Results	2
