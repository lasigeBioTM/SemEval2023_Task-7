Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Objective Response Assessed by the Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)	Results	1
A patient had an objective response if they had a complete response or a partial response on 2 consecutive occasions  4 weeks apart. For target lesions, a complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; a partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. For non-target lesions, a complete response was defined as the disappearance of all non-target lesions; a partial response was defined as the persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions.	Results	2
