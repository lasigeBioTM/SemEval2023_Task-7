capecitabine	CHEBI:31348	28-40
Participants received IV trastuzumab (8 mg/kg) for first cycle and then 6 mg/kg for subsequent cycles followed by bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) on Day 1 of each treatment cycles along with capecitabine administered orally to participants at a dose of 1000 mg/m^2 BID on Days 1 to 14 of each treatment cycle until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity or participant request for discontinuation.

Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)	Results	1
Tumor response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.0. BOR was defined as the best response recorded for a participant from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Percentage of participants with a BOR of confirmed CR or PR (responders) was reported. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Confirmed responses were those which were confirmed by a repeat assessment, performed 4 weeks after the criteria for response first met.	Results	2
