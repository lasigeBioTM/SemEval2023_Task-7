Surgeon's opinion at the time of surgery that the subject's well-being would be compromised (e.g. significant comorbidities, intraoperative findings of a higher stage cancer or other independent acute health problems). If the contralateral breast is undergoing a nipple-sparing mastectomy with reconstruction as well, then the contralateral breast can be studied so long as there is no compromise to any element of their care.

The Spy device quantifies perfusion by measuring relative fluorescence of indocyanine green bound to plasma proteins. This produces an intensity value of 0-255 based on an 8-bit greyscale. The investigators measured this value preoperatively when measured and compared to the post-intervention measurement. The device can calculate the cumulative intensity of a defined region of interest which the investigators categorized as the lateral, lower, medial, or nipple-areola region of the breast. The investigators also evaluated the cumulative value of these areas in total. Rate of perfusion was simply this value over time (90 seconds).	Results	3
