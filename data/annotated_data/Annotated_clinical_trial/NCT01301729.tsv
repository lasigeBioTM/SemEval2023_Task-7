Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression-Free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
PFS was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 and was defined as the time from the date when the participant signed the informed consent form (ICF) until death or progressive disease (PD). PD was defined as 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. PFS and associated confidence intervals were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.	Results	2
