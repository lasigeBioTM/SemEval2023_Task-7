Ipsilateral Breast Tumor Recurrence	Results	1
breast	UBERON:0000310	12-18
We defined local relapse (true recurrence) as the reappearance of the breast cancer in the index quadrant and ipsilateral breast tumours as any new breast cancer diagnosed in other quadrants of the same breast. The sum of local relapses and new ipsilateral breast tumours was defined as the ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR). Locoregional tumour recurrence also included any recurrence in the ipsilateral axillary, supraclavicular, or internal mammary chain nodal regions.here we report the percentage of participants in each arm who experienced "Ipsilateral Breast Tumor Recurrence"	Results	2
