Surgical resection -	Eligibility	9
All tumor should be removed by either a modified radical mastectomy or a lumpectomy. Patients must be registered  84 days from mastectomy or within 84 days of axillary dissection if patient's most extensive breast surgery was a breast sparing procedure.	Eligibility	10

Node dissection: Axillary node dissection is not required. Management of the axilla is at the discretion of the treating physician. There is no restriction on eligibility based on the number of nodes removed.	Eligibility	11
Mastectomy: There should be no evidence of gross or microscopic invasive tumor at the surgical resection margins noted in the final surgery or pathology reports for patients who have had a modified radical mastectomy. Patients with close margins (tumor < 1 mm from margin) are eligible.	Eligibility	12

Relapse-free Survival Rates at 2.4 Years	Results	1
Percentage of participants who were alive and relapse-free at time of analysis were counted as "Alive without relapse" at 2.4 years. Participants who had a first local recurrence, first distant metastasis or death from any cause were counted as "relapse, first occurrence". These rates were estimated using the Kaplan Meier method	Results	2
