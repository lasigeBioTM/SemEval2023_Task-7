Clinical Benefit Response (Independent Reviewer-assessed)	Results	1
CBR is defined as the percentage of participants receiving at least one dose of study medication who achieved a best overall response classified as a complete or partial (confirmed) tumor response or stable disease for at least 6 months (24 weeks). A "complete response" is defined as the disappearance of all target or non-target lesions, "partial response" and "disease progression" as at least a 30% decrease and at least a 20% increase, respectively, in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and "stable disease" as neither "partial response" nor "disease progression."
