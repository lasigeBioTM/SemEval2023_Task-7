Vaginal dryness was measured by the numerical analogue scale at baseline and through the six weeks of treatment. The item scores was transformed into 0 to 100 scales with 0=poor quality of life (QOL) and 100=best possible QOL. The average AUC values were calculated by dividing 6 from AUC values for participants who completed item on all 6 weeks. If a participant completed the item at baseline, week 1, 2 and 3 but did not complete the item at week 4 to week 6, the AUC values of the item was prorated, which is (((AUC values * 6) / 3) / 6). The average pro-rated AUC for vaginal dryness scores was compared in each of the Pilocarpine arms against the collective placebo arm.	Results	2
