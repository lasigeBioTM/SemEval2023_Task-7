Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression-Free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to first occurrence of disease progression (either radiographic or clinical), or death from any cause. PFS was determined using radiographic progression defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) on measurable lesions captured by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical disease progression was considered only when disease progression could not be confirmed by CT or MRI, such as when the disease site is skin, bone marrow, or central nervous system.	Results	2
