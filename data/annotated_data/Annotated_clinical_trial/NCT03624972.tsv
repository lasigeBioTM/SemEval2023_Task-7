Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Self-Reported Self-Efficacy for Communicating About Sexual Health Issues	Results	1
Two items assessed patients' self-efficacy (confidence) for communicating with their breast cancer clinician about sexual health concerns in terms of either talking (item 1) or asking (item 2) about sexual health. Response options used an 11-point scale (0=not at all confident/not at all to 10=extremely confident/very much). Mean scores across the two items were used, ranging from 0-10. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.	Results	2
