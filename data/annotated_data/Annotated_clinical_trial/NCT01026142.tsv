Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression Free Survival (Independent Assessment)	Results	1
Progression Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression (PD), as determined by an Independent Review Facility (IRF) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. IRF review of tumor assessment ceased after the primary PFS analysis. The primary endpoint was analyzed after approximately 337 IRF-assessed PFS events were observed.	Results	2
