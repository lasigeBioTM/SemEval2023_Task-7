Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Overall Survival: Intention to Treat (ITT) Population	Results	1
Duration of OS was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death due to any cause. Subjects were followed until their date of death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent for further follow-up for survival, or final database closure. OS was determined using the ITT population which included all subjects randomized into 1 of the 2 treatment arms. Subjects who were lost-to-follow-up or were not known to have died were censored at last date they were shown to be alive. Subjects who did not have any follow-up since the date of randomization were censored at the date of randomization.	Results	2
