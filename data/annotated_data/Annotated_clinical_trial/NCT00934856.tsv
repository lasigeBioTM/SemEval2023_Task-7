INTERVENTION 1:	Intervention	0
MBC: T-DM1 2.4 mg/kg + Doc 75 mg/m^2 (Over 2 Days)	Intervention	1
Participants with HER2-positive MBC received docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 IV infusion on Day 1 and T-DM1 2.4 mg/kg IV infusion on Day 2 of Cycle 1 followed by T-DM1 75 mg/m^2 and docetaxel 2.4 mg/kg IV infusion on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for a minimum of 6 cycles.
