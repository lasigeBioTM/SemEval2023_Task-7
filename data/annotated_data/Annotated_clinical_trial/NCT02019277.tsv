Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab, and Taxane	Intervention	1
taxane	CHEBI:36064	29-35
Participants received first-line therapy with pertuzumab administered via IV infusion on Day 1 of first treatment cycle (1 cycle = 21 days) at a loading dose of 840 mg, followed by 420 mg on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle; trastuzumab administered via SC injection at a dose of 600 mg on Day 2 of first treatment cycle, and on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle if both pertuzumab and trastuzumab were well tolerated in Cycle 1; and taxane treatment (docetaxel, paclitaxel, or nabpaclitaxel), administered at the discretion of the investigator, per routine clinical practices and local prescribing instructions. Participants continued study treatment until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Participants with unacceptable toxicity or PD were switched to standard treatment of the investigator's choice. All participants were followed-up until withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, death, or study closure.	Intervention	2

Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs	Results	1
An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Percentage of participants with AEs and SAEs was reported. AEs included both SAEs and non-SAEs. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed using Clopper-Pearson method.	Results	2
