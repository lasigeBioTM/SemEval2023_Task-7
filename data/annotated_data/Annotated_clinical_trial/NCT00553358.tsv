Pathological complete response is defined as no invasive cancer in the breast or only non-invasive in situ cancer in the breast specimen. Surgical breast and axillary node resection specimens were evaluated for pathologic tumor response according to National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) guidelines, which do not take into account the histological nodal status.
