Breast Cancer Locator (BCL)	Intervention	1
breast cancer	DOID:1612	0-13
The Breast Cancer Locator (BCL) uses 3D printing to create a bra-like plastic form that matches the breast surface when the patient is in the supine MRI (and surgical) position. This locator will be constructed pre-operatively, sterilized and provided to the surgeon at the time of the procedure.	Intervention	2

Breast Cancer Locator (BCL): This locator is constructed pre-operatively, sterilized and provided to the surgeon at the time of the procedure. The outline of the breast cancer on the breast surface at the point where the cancer is closest to the skin is built into the locator so that the surgeon can simply apply the locator to the patient's breast and trace the tumor outline on the skin.

The Distance Measured by Pathology From the Tumor Edge to the Center of the Ink Spots, as Marked by the Black Inked Pins.	Results	1
Five measurements will be made per patient and the mean difference in distance will be derived between the palpated and the co-registered supine MRI-optical scan image predicted tumor edges. The BCL will be considered accurate if all 5 measurements are > 0 cm from the tumor edge.	Results	2
