rate	BAO:0080019	25-29
Overall response rate of single agent cetuximab and cetuximab + carboplatin will be measured by radiographic response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria every 8 weeks until subject experiences disease progression. Overall response will be measured as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD).Per RECIST v1.0 for target lesions and assessed by CT (spiral): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), >=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progression, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression	Results	2
