A visual 'patient-based' classification capturing the whole disease burden was developed by using a side-by-side display, comparing baseline FDG-PET/CT(showing all FDG-positive mets independent of their HER2-imaging status) & day4 HER2-PET/CT. Pts were grouped into 4 HER2-PET/CT patterns according to the proportion of FDG avid tumour load showing relevant 89Zr-T uptake. Pattern A: entire tumor load showed pertinent tracer uptake; B: dominant part of tumour load showed tracer uptake; C: minor part of tumor load showed tracer uptake; D: entire tumor load lacked tracer uptake. Patterns A+B='HER2-positive' & C+D='HER2-negative'. In the 20 pts: 4 pts were classified "A", 5"B", 1"C" & 10"D". This classification indicates substantial heterogeneity of 89Zr-T uptake within this so called 'HER2-positive' pt population. After dichotomization, 11(55%) pts were considered as HER2-PET/CT negative. Furthermore, HER2-PET/CT revealed intrapatient heterogeneity of tumour uptake(pts classified B or C).	Results	2
