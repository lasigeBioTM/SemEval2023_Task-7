Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
The Proportion of Patients With RS 11-25 Who Refused the Assigned Treatment	Results	1
The primary purpose of this trial is to determine the feasibility of carrying out a large multi-center trial with a similar design. Feasibility, in terms of less than 1/3 of patients with intermediate (11-25) Recurrence Score (RS) who refused the assigned treatment (Group 2) or refused randomization between hormonal (Arm 1) or chemotherapy (Arm 2). The confidence interval will be 95%. The proportion (and 95% confidence interval) of patients with RS 11-25 who refuse the assigned treatment will be calculated.	Results	2
