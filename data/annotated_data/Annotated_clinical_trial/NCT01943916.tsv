Specificity Difference Between Imagio Optoacoustic Plus Gray-scale (OA/US) vs Imagio Gray-scale Ultrasound (IUS)	Results	1
Primary effectiveness endpoint was the difference in specificity for the Imagio OA/US relative to IUS, across all 7 independent readers; both imaging modalities used in each subject (subject as own control); results for each imaging modality compared to biopsy diagnosis or 12-month follow-up ruling of benign as determined by truth panel (ground truth)	Results	2
Time frame: Baseline to 12 months +/- 30 days follow-up	Results	3
