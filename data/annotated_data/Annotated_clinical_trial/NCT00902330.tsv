Arm I (Cranial Microcurrent Electrical Stimulation [CES])	Intervention	1
stimulation	BAO:0000093	39-50
Patients receive a CES unit (Alpha-Stim® 100 Microcurrent Stimulator) that passes microcurrent levels of biphasic electrical stimulation via ear-lobe electrodes. The CES unit is preset to provide 1 hour of 100 μA (sub-sensory level), modified square-wave biphasic stimulation on a 50% duty cycle at .05 Hz, and to automatically turn off at the end of 1 hour. Patients use their CES unit once daily in weeks 1-18.	Intervention	2

Using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) a 14 item scale, 7 relate to anxiety, 7 to depression; each item is scored from 0-3, a person can score 0 to 21 for either anxiety or depression (0 is best and 21 is worst), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short-form measures the intensity and interference of pain in the patient's life; 12 questions with 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes); mean will be used as the measure of pain; Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) assess the severity and impact of cancer-related fatigue. Has 9 questions with 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes), the total mean score is the mean of the 9 questions; severe fatigue can be defined as a score of 7 or higher, General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS) 21 items to evaluate sleep issues (0=never to 7=every day); the 21 items are summed to produce a total score of 9=no sleep disturbance to 137=extreme sleep disturbance .
