Pathological Complete Response (pCR) Per Investigator Assessment for Alpelisib vs. Placebo for PIK3CA Mutant Cohort	Results	1
Pathologic complete response (pCR) defined as absence of any residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the resected breast specimen and all sampled ipsilateral lymph nodes following completion of 24 weeks of treatment by local assessment (ypT0/Tis ypN0). Patients who experienced progression of disease while undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, or who did not receive surgery for any reason, or received antineoplastic treatment other than study drug(s) before surgery were considered as non-responders for the calculation of pCR rate.
