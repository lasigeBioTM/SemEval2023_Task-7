Time to Tumor Progression (TTP)	Results	1
time	PATO:0000165	0-4
ttp	CHEBI:63550	27-30
Time in days from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer, whichever comes first. TTP was calculated as first event date minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease [PD]).	Results	2
