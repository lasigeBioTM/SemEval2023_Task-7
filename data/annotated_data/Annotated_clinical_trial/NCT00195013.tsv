The effects of glutamine on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.	Eligibility	7

Exclusion Criteria:	Eligibility	9
Patients who have experienced prior neuropathies not associated with chemotherapy	Eligibility	10
Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.	Eligibility	11
Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.	Eligibility	12

Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with glutamine. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated.	Eligibility	16
excluded	HP:0040285	201-209

Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Change in Peripheral Neuropathy Score	Results	1
peripheral neuropathy	HP:0009830,DOID:870	10-31
Used the clinical total neuropathy score scale (TNSc). The presence of sensory, motor, pin sensibility, vibration sensibility, DTR, autonomic symptoms was assessed. For each item, the possible score ranged between 0 (normal) and 4 (worst possible result).	Results	2
neuropathy	DOID:870	24-34
result	BAO:0000179	247-253
Outcomes calculated as neuropathy score value at 10 Weeks minus neuropathy score value at Baseline. Increased score value indicates increased neuropathy severity.	Results	3
