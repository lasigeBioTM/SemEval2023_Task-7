Phase I: Dasatinib 100mg/Trastuzumab 2mg/kg/Paclitaxel 80mg/m2	Intervention	1
Cohort 1: Eligible patients were enrolled and treated with 4-week cycles of trastuzumab 2 mg/kg IV weekly (following a loading dose of 4 mg/kg in cycle 1) and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly x 3 weeks followed by a rest period of 7 days. Dasatinib 100mg was administered orally once daily (QD). Treatment was repeated on Day 1 of a 28-day cycle until radiographic or symptomatic progression or unacceptable toxicity occured.
