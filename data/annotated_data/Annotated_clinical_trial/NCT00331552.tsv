Phase I: Cyclophosphamide, Doxil, Trastuzumab	Intervention	1
cyclophosphamide	CHEBI:4026	9-25
Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-28 and pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Some patients with HER2/neu 3+ disease may also receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes weekly or every 3 weeks at the discretion of the treating physician.	Intervention	2
