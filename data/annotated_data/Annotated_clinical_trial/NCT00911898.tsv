Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Maximum Feasible Dose	Results	1
mtd	BAO:0001248	24-27
The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was defined as the highest dose level in which a DLT is experienced by fewer than two patients in a cohort of 3 - 6 patients. If a DLT is observed in at least two patients in a cohort of 3 - 6 patients, the MTD will be determined to have been exceeded and an additional three patients (up to a total of six) are to be treated at the next lower dose level.
