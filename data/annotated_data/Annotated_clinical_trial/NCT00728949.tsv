Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression-Free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Participants without documentation of progression or death will be censored at the date of last tumor assessment. The PFS will be estimated following the Kaplan-Meier method.	Results	2
