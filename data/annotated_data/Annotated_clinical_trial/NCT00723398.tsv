Change in Absolute Breast Density	Results	1
breast	UBERON:0000310	19-25
Change of absolute breast density as indicated by mammography from baseline to Year +1 and completion of study (Year +2). No other mammograms will be obtained or used for the purpose of this study. Absolute breast density volume is based on breast thickness and the x-ray attenuation at each pixel of the image.	Results	2
