bone resorption	GO:0045453	0-15
Serum NTx level is used to aid in predicting skeletal response (bone mineral density) to antiresorptive therapy and in monitoring bone resorption changes following initiation of antiresorptive therapy. Elevated levels of serum NTx indicate elevated bone resorption. Elevated bone resorption is the primary cause of agerelated bone loss and that low bone mass often results in osteopenia and is the major cause of osteoporosis. The measurement range is in nanoMoles (NM) Bone Collagen Equivalents (BCE).	Results	3
