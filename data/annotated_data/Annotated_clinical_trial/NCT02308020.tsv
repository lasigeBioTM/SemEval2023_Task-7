Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR): Objective Intracranial Response Rate (OIRR)	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	118-122
OIRR is the percentage of participants with a (CR) or (PR) based on the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastasis (RANO-BM) response criteria. CR is measurable target lesions, the disappearance of all central nervous system (CNS) target lesions for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; no corticosteroids; stable or improved clinically. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum longest duration (LD) of CNS target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; stable to decreased corticosteroid dose; stable or improved clinically. Nontarget lesions requires disappearance CNS non-target lesions and no new CNS lesions. Stable disease (SD) is less than (<)30% decrease relative to baseline but <20% increase in sum LD relative to nadir. Progressive disease (PD) is greater than or equal to (  ) 20% increase in sum LD relative to nadir and a relative increase of 20%, 1 lesion must increase by absolute value of 5 millimeter (mm).
