Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Sensitivity of the G8 Questionnaire	Results	1
Sensitivity of the G8 questionnaire measured as Percentage of Participants with a Positive G8 among patients with a positive MGA. The G8 consists of eight items: patient age (>85, 80-85, <80), and seven items from the original 18-item MNA (Mini Nutritional Assessment: appetite changes, weight loss, mobility, neuropsychological problems, body mass index, medication, and self-rated health). The total score ranges from 0 to 17, with lower scores indicating a higher risk of impairments. The cut-off value for an 'impaired' reference test score was <=14.	Results	2

Multidimensional geriatric assessment (MGA): Patients underwent a geriatric evaluation in the month following the completion of VES-13. The nurse completed six instruments of the MGA (MNA, Timed Get up and Go, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental ADL, Mini Mental State Examination, and Geriatric Depression Scale, and the geriatrician rated comorbidity on the Cumulative Illnes Rating Scale.
