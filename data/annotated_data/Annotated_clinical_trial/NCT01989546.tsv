Talazoparib (BMN 673)	Intervention	1
Single-agent BMN 673 (talazoparib) dosed orally at 1 mg/day in 28-day cycles. This poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor has been shown to cause single-agent synthetic lethality in breast cancer 1 and breast cancer 2 (BRCA1/2)- and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient cell lines, and has potent antitumor activity in animal models of tumors harboring mutations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair pathways.

The effects of BMN 673 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because PARP inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 30 days after completing study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after completion of BMN 673 administration.
