Mean total MRI FTV change from baseline to month 3 (V3): For patients with more than one measureable lesion on the MRI, the sum over all measureable lesions on the MRI was calculated at each time point. V3 was calculated by subtracting the total MRI FTV measured (i.e. the sum over all lesions present with MRI FTV measurements) at 3 months from the total MRI FTV measured at baseline. For V3 the raw change in the volume will be calculated for each patient and a mean and 95% confidence interval will be constructed using two-sided t-tests.	Results	2
