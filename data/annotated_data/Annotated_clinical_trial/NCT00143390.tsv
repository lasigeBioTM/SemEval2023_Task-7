ttp	CHEBI:63550	21-24
Time in months from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to breast cancer, whichever comes first. Tumor progression was determined by the expert evaluation committee using RECIST version 1.0 as an at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of the target lesions compared to the smallest SLD since the study treatment started. For participants with bone metastasis only, at least 25% increase in the measurable lesion according to General Rules for Clinical and Pathological Study of Breast Cancer (The 14th edition).
