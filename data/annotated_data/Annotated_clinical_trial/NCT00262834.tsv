Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Number of Participants With Adverse Events	Results	1
Participants were evaluated for adverse events due to vorinostat to assess if it was safe to give the drug prior to surgery. 17 of 25 participants who received vorinostat experienced at least 1 adverse event believed to be related to the study drug; no adverse events were severe, and the treatment was considered safe.
