Objective Response Assessed by the Independent Review Facility Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)	Results	1
Objective response was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) determined on 2 consecutive occasions  4 weeks apart, using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR: The disappearance of all target lesions and all non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker level, and no new lesions. PR: Disappearance of all target lesions and persistence of  1 non-target lesions and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits, or, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and no new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
