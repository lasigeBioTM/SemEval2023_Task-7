Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Number of Responders	Results	1
Using the Numerical Rating Score (NRS) for pain (0 being no pain and 10 being worst imaginable pain), each subject was rated as a Responder or Non-responder. A responder is defined as a subject with a reduction in NRS worst score from baseline of two (2) or more points, and no increase in pain medication use.	Results	2
