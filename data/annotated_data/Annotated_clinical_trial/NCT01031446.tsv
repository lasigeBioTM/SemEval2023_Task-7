The recommended dose for the Phase II trial will be the most prevalent dose delivered per week in Phase I that allows for safe and feasible administration of the medications.The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more of 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the initial cycle of therapy. DLTs include Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 0.5 x 10 9/L for > 5 days), febrile neutropenia (ANC < 1.0 x 10 0/L with fever > 38.5 degrees Centigrade) or documented infection associated with Grade 3-4 neutropenia, CTC Grade 4 thrombocytopenia < 25 x 10 9/L or CTC Grade 3 < 50-25 x 10 9/L thrombocytopenia with bleeding, and Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity despite symptomatic therapy.
