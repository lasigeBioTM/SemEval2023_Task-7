Due to unknown risks and potential harm to the unborn fetus, sexually active women of childbearing potential must use a reliable method of birth control while participating in this study. Reliable methods of birth control are: abstinence (not having sex), oral contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), DepoProvera, tubal ligation, or vasectomy of the partner (with confirmed negative sperm counts) in a monogamous relationship (same partner). An acceptable, although less reliable, method involves the careful use of condoms and spermicidal foam or gel and/or a cervical cap or sponge. We encourage you to discuss this issue further with your doctors if you have any questions.	Eligibility	20

If you are pregnant, should become pregnant or suspect you are pregnant prior to or while participating in this study, you should inform your study physician immediately. Nicotine replacement therapy has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects and is classified as a FDA Pregnancy category D drug. The U.S. Clinical Practice Guideline states that pregnant smokers should be encouraged to quit without medication based on insufficient evidence of effectiveness and hypothetical concerns with safety. Pregnant women enrolled in the study and randomized to the Quitline group intervention should participate in the Quitline intervention but not receive the nicotine replacement therapy.	Eligibility	21
