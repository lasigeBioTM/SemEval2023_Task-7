Exclusion Criteria:	Eligibility	2
Subjects will be excluded for a number of medical conditions that are contraindications to XRT and/or might confound the relationship among fatigue, and inflammation, including pregnancy, major psychiatric disorders, autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, chronic infectious diseases (e.g. HIV, hepatitis B or C), neurologic disorders and uncontrolled cardiovascular, metabolic, pulmonary or renal disease (as determined by medical history, physical examination and laboratory testing). Subjects with a history of a major psychiatric disorder including Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder or a diagnosis of Substance Abuse or Dependence within the past 1 year (as determined by standardized psychiatric interview) will be excluded. Subjects taking drugs known to affect the immune system (e.g. glucocorticoids, methotrexate) will also be excluded. Subjects using supplements or other natural products with one week of starting medications, excluding vitamins and calcium supplementation or at the discretion of the attending physician, will be excluded. Patients who have evidence of infection as determined by history, physical exam or laboratory testing (complete blood count and urinalysis) at baseline will be excluded. In addition, patients who develop evidence of infection (as determined by history, physical exam or laboratory testing) during the study will be discontinued from the study.	Eligibility	3

Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
PBMC NF-kB DNA Binding Measured in ng/Well	Results	1
dna binding	GO:0003677	11-22
The primary outcome to be measured will be the change in NF-kB DNA binding (measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as ng/well) after six weeks of treatment with daily placebo or Meriva. NF-kB DNA binding and has been associated with fatigue in breast cancer patients.	Results	2
