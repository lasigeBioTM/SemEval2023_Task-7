Pathologic Complete Response	Results	1
For the purpose of this study, a pathologic complete response (pCR) was defined as no evidence of residual invasive tumor in the breast (pT0) and axillary lymph nodes (pN0), gross or microscopic, in the sample removed at the time of surgical resection. Residual ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ was not considered in pCR assessments. Percentage of participants who experienced pCR is reported.	Results	2
