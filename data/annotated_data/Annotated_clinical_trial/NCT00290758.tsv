epithelial cell proliferation	GO:0050673	17-46
Breast epithelial tissue samples are used to measure the expression of the cell proliferation marker Ki-67, by counting the percentage of positive MIB-1 immunostained cells, denoted the Ki-67 labeling index. Mean change in the Ki-67 labeling index is assessed from baseline to 6 month follow up.	Results	2
