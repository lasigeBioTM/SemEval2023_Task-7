Mean intercourse pain reported by subjects using the Numerical Rating Scale pain ratings (range 0-10, 0 being "no pain" and 10 being "worst possible pain"). Testing was during weeks 0-4 (Phase II) (with blinded randomization for placebo vs active intervention medication) and testing was during weeks 5-12 (Phase III) (with open-label active medication for 8 weeks after completing the blinded 4 weeks). Subjects agreed to try penetration twice per week and score their pain using the Numerical Rating Scale pain ratings.The scores were averaged during each phase.	Results	2
