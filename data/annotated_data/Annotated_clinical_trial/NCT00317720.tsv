Optimal Dose of RAD001 in Combination With Trastuzumab (Phase I)	Results	1
In Phase I, two dose levels of RAD001 were studied: 10 mg (dose level 1) and 5 mg (dose level -1) where each dose was evaluated after cycle 1. At MDACC, the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) for determining Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was applied to the two predefined RAD001 dose levels; and at DFCI/BIDMC, a 3 x 3 study design was utilized.

Optimal dose defined as the dose most closely associated with a toxicity rate of 0.20, and toxicity defined as any grade 3 or 4 toxicity (based on Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) version 3.0 except fatigue. Participants underwent clinical evaluation every 3 weeks (one cycle) and radiologic evaluations every 6 weeks. After the second cycle, participants underwent a radiologic evaluation using the same imaging technique used at initial evaluation (ie, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging).	Results	3
