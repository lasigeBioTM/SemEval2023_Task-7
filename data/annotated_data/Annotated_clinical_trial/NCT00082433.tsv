Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Overall Survival (OS)	Results	1
Overall survival was defined as the time in months from randomization until the date of death. For those patients who had not died, survival duration was censored at the last date the patient was known to be alive. Median OS with 95% CI estimated using the Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Method.
