Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)	Results	1
For DLT evaluation, severity (grade) was classified according to common terminology criteria for adverse events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0). DLTs were defined as grade 4 neutropenia persisting for more than 7 days; grade 3 or above febrile neutropenia; grade 4 thrombocytopenia or grade 3 thrombocytopenia requiring blood transfusion; non-hematologic toxicity (excluding toxicity related to neutrophils, leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelets, CD4 lymphocytes, anemia, and bone marrow density) greater than or equal to grade 3 (Exceptions: Dose reduction was not required even when the following conditions were met: grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea controllable with anti-emetic or anti-diarrheal medication and abnormal laboratory parameter not requiring treatment); and day 8 administration was delayed or skipped as a result of the subject did not meet the dosing riteria within cycle.
