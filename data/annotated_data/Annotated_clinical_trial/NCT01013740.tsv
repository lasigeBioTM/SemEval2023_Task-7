Progression Free Survival (PFS) in the Randomized Phase	Results	1
PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, if sooner. PD is defined as at least a 20 % increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of >=1 new lesion.
