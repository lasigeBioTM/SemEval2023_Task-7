Disease Free Survival	Results	1
disease	DOID:4,OGMS:0000031	0-7
Disease free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the time of recurrence of the primary disease. Local or nodal recurrence and metastatic disease were considered a recurrence of the primary tumour. Patients who had contralateral breast cancer or a second primary malignancy, or died from some cause other than disease were censored as relapse-free at the time of death. Patients who had not relapsed were censored at longest follow-up or at non-breast cancer death. As required, adjudication was used to assess reports of recurrence.	Results	2
