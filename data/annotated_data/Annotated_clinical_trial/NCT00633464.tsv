Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR; Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST])	Results	1
The participant had an OR if her best overall response (BOR) during the study was either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) according to the RECIST as determined by the investigator. CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions. Confidence interval (CI) was Computed using Clopper-Pearson method.	Results	2
