Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Independent Radiology Review Committee (IRRC)	Results	1
PFS defined as the time in months from randomization to date of progression. Patients who died without a reported prior progression were considered to have progressed on date of death; those who didn't progress or die were censored on date of last tumor assessment. Median PFS time with 95% CI estimated using the Kaplan Meier product limit method.	Results	2
