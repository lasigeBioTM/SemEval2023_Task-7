Palbociclib+Letrozole	Intervention	1
Participants received palbociclib orally once daily at 125 mg for 21 days followed by 7 days off treatment for each 28-day cycle, and letrozole orally at 2.5 mg QD as a continuous daily dosing schedule.

Number of Participants With All-causality Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)	Results	1
An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment. All AEs reported after initiation of study drug treatment were considered as TEAE. AE severity was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) version 4.03. Grade 1 AEs are mild AEs; Grade 2 AEs are moderate AEs; Grade 3 AEs are severe AEs, Grade 4 AEs are life-threatening consequences and Grade 5 AEs are deaths related to AEs. Each AE was counted once for the participant in the most severe severity.	Results	2
