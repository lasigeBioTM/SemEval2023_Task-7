eribulin mesylate	CHEBI:70710	0-17
Eribulin mesylate was given at a dose of 1.4 mg/m^2 as a 2 to 5 minute IV bolus on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle during the Treatment and Extension Phases. The Treatment Phase included six cycles. Following the sixth cycle of the Treatment Phase, participants who demonstrated clinical benefit could continue treatment during the Extension Phase for an indefinite number of cycles for as long as clinical benefit was sustained (up to 211 weeks).

Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Neuropathy Adverse Events (AEs)	Results	1
neuropathy	DOID:870	51-61
Neuropathy AEs were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 3.0 and coded according to the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Neuropathy AEs included the broad list of preferred terms (PTs) defined in the Standard MedDRA Query for Neuropathy and the following additional PTs: neuropathy, hyperesthesia, painful response to normal stimuli, pallanesthesia, and allodynia. If the post-baseline maximum CTCAE grade of the combined term "neuropathy" was greater than the baseline maximum CTCAE grade of the combined term, then the event was considered as treatment emergent neuropathy adverse events per CTCAE grade. For a single participant, 1) a neuropathy AE occurring more than once during the study, whether defined with the same or different MedDRA PTs, was counted only once, 2) a neuropathy AE with different CTCAE grades had only the highest grade AE counted.
