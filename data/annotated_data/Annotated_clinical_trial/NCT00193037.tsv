Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Overall Response Rate (ORR), the Percentage of Patients Who Experience an Objective Benefit From Treatment	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	17-21
ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who exhibit a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). Complete Response is the total disappearance of clinically and radiologically detectable disease for at least 4 weeks. Partial Response is at least a 50% reduction of all measurable lesions as measured by the product of the perpendicular diameters of the greatest dimensions of tumor size, with no new lesions appearing for at least four weeks.
