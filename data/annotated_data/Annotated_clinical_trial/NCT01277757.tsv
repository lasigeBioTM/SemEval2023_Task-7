Archived primary tumor biopsies or surgical specimens, or biopsies of recurrence or metastasis, will be available for PIK3CA/Akt mutational analysis and PTEN analysis; patients with surgical samples, or core/punch biopsies available, will be eligible for testing for PIK3CA/Akt status as well as PTEN testing; the most recent sample will be preferred (i.e. in patients with metastatic disease, metastases samples are preferred over archival primary tumor and in patients with local recurrences a biopsy of the recurrence is preferred over archival primary tumor); NOTE: PIK3CA or Akt mutation status can be determined on fine needle aspirate (FNA) samples, but PTEN status cannot as stroma and endothelial cells are used as internal controls and PTEN testing has not been validated on FNA samples; thus patients with only FNA samples and no tissue blocks available will be considered to be eligible for screening for PIK3CA/Akt mutations and will be enrolled onto the study only if they are found to have PIK3CA mutations or Akt mutations; patients whose tumors have already been tested in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) environment and have been found to have a PIK3CA mutation or Akt mutation or PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or PTEN mutation will be eligible for treatment; patients whose tumors have been tested in the research environment and found to have a PIK3CA mutation or Akt mutation or PTEN loss or PTEN mutation will have their marker status confirmed in the CLIA environment	Eligibility	4

Number of Participants With Response Defined Using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)	Results	1
Number of participants with response defined by RECIST version 1.1: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.	Results	2
