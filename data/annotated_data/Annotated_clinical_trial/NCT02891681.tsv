INTERVENTION 1:	Intervention	0
NIR/US (Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Cohort)	Intervention	1
Patients will have the NIR/US baseline scan performed before their first treatment. The desirable schedule will be >= 7 days after initial biopsy to avoid confounding effects from the biopsy related acute inflammatory response.	Intervention	2
acute inflammatory response	GO:0002526	199-226
In addition, patients will also have NIR/US performed at end of cycle 1, end of cycle 2, end of cycle 3, end of cycle 5 (only if treatment regimen changed), and prior to surgery.	Intervention	3

Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Pathologic Response Based on Miller-Payne Grading System	Results	1
In the Miller-Payne system, the pathologic response is divided into 5 grades based on comparison of tumor cellularity between pre-neoadjuvant core biopsy and definitive surgical specimen as:	Results	2
grade 1: no change or some alteration to individual malignant cells but no reduction in overall cellularity (pNR)	Results	3
grade 2: a minor loss of tumor cells but overall cellularity still high; up to 30% (pPR)	Results	4
grade 3: between an estimated 30% and 90% reduction in tumor cells (pPR)	Results	5
grade 4: a marked disappearance of tumor cells such that only small clusters or widely dispersed individual cells remain (almost pCR); more than 90% loss of tumor cells	Results	6
grade 5: no malignant cells identifiable in sections from the site of the tumor; only vascular fibroelastonic stroma remains often containing macrophages (pCR) (however, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may be present)	Results	7
