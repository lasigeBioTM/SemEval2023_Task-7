Difference for Sensitivity for Detection of Full Extent of Malignant Breast Disease Using CMRM vs UMRM Per Reader	Results	1
breast disease	DOID:3463	69-83
For a single participant the sensitivity was defined as the proportion of malignant breast regions that were recognized by the clinical investigators and the 3 blinded readers using the respective imaging modality as malignant. Subsequently the sensitivity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the sensitivities across all participants. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value. For ease of expression, the following abbreviations will be used: Magnetic Resonance Mammography (MRM), Unenhanced MRM (UMRM), combined unenhanced and contrast (gadobutrol)-enhanced MRM (CMRM), X-ray mammography (XRM).
