Clinical Response Rate (cRR)	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	18-22
cRR measured by RECIST for target lesions assessed by clinical exam+ mammogram+ ultrasound (US). cRR is defined as number of patients who's best response in any of the assessments (clinical exam/mammogram/US) is CR+PR. Response will be defined as one of the following in either clinical exam, mammogram or US: Complete Response (CR)-Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR)>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum.	Results	2
