TTP was defined as the time from onset of treatment with study drug until first evidence/diagnosis of progressive disease or - in the absence of any diagnosis of progressive disease - until the participant´s death. Diagnosis of progressive disease was done according to RECIST (Version 1.0) and/or investigator assessment based on RECIST. RECIST criteria used changes in the largest diameter of target/non-target lesions. Target (measurable) lesions were up to a maximum of 5 per organ & >20 mm by clinical imaging (>=10 mm with spiral CT scan). Non-target lesions were all other lesions.	Results	2
