Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)	Results	1
An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. TEAEs were the AEs occurring from starting on the day of or after first administration of trastuzumab and within 28 days after last dose of trastuzumab. Data for this outcome measure were analyzed and reported by adjuvant versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy groups within each treatment arm.	Results	2
