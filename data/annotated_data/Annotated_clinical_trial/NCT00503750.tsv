Trastuzumab and Abraxane Followed Trastuzumab and Vinorelbine	Intervention	1
vinorelbine	CHEBI:480999	50-61
Patients will be treated sequentially with preoperative trastuzumab and dose-dense ABI-007 followed by trastuzumab in combination with vinorelbine. Trastuzumab will be administered as a one-time loading dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90 minute infusion, followed by 20 weekly treatments at 2 mg/kg as a 30 minute infusion. ABI-007 will be administered every 2 weeks at a dose of 260mg/m2 as 30 minute infusion on the same days as trastuzumab for a total of 4 cycles (weeks 1 -8). Growth factor support with pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) is required 24 to 48 hours following completion of each cycle of ABI-007. Beginning week 9, patients will then receive weekly vinorelbine at a dose of 25mg/m2 for 12 weeks on the same day as trastuzumab for a total of 4 cycles (weeks 9-20). As per standard treatment of HER2-positive breast cancers, patients will continue to receive trastuzumab every 3 weeks at 6 mg/kg beginning week 21 through week 52.	Intervention	2
