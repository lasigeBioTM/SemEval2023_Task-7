Albumin-bound Paclitaxel, Carboplatin + Herceptin	Intervention	1
paclitaxel	CHEBI:45863	14-24
carboplatin	CHEBI:31355	26-37
Participants received albumin-bound paclitaxel, 100 mg/m^2 weekly every 3 out of 4 weeks, carboplatin at an area under the curve (AUC) = 6 every 4 weeks and Herceptin weekly, 4 mg/kg the first week and 2 mg/kg on all subsequent weeks by intravenous (IV) infusion for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Participants could continue treatment with chemotherapy beyond 6 cycles at the discretion of the investigator, but Herceptin therapy was to continue to be administered weekly (2 mg/kg) until intercurrent illness, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal or administration of any non-protocol anti-cancer treatment.

Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Objective Confirmed Complete or Partial Overall Response	Results	1
Percentage of participants who achieved an objective confirmed complete or partial overall response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. A complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all known disease and no new sites or disease related symptoms confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. A partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. PR is also recorded when all measurable disease has completely disappeared, but a non-measurable component (i.e., ascites) is still present but not progressing, or with the persistence of one or more non-target lesions and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.
