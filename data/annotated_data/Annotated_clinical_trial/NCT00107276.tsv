Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Response Rate (Complete and Partial, Confirmed and Unconfirmed)	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	9-13
Complete Response (CR) is complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease. No new lesions, no disease related symptoms. Normalization of markers and other abnormal lab values. Partial Response (PR) is greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of longest diameters of all target measurable lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease. No new lesions. Confirmation of CR or PR means a repeat scan at least 4 weeks apart documented before progression or symptomatic deterioration. Progression is 20% increase in sum of longest diameters of target measurable lesions over smallest sum observed and/or unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease and/or appearance of new lesion/site or death due to disease without prior documentation of progression and without symptomatic deterioration. Symptomatic deterioration is global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of progression.	Results	2
