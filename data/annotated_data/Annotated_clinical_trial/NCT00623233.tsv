Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Time	Results	1
time	PATO:0000165	32-36
PFS was measured from date of first dose to first date of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. For each participant who was not known to have died or to have had PD as of the data inclusion cut-off date for a particular analysis, PFS duration was censored for that analysis at the date of the participant's last progression-free tumor assessment before that cut-off date.
