Number of Patients With Progression-free Survival (PFS) at 24 Weeks	Results	1
A patient is judged as progression-free survive at Week 24 if their PFS time is at least 24 weeks with no progression event prior to Week 24 (ie, overall visit response is complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at a tumour assessment at least 24 weeks after randomization). Overall visit response is assessed according to the RECIST version 1.1. %PFS is the proportion of patients with PFS.	Results	2
