This endpoint evaluated the progression free survival (PFS) of participants amongst the total evaluable population. Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to either the date the subject was first recorded as having PD (even if the subject went off treatment because of toxicity), or the date of death if the subject died due to any causes before progression. Participants with no recorded post-baseline tumor assessment had PFS censored at the day of randomization. Participants lost to follow-up were censored at the last date of contact. Participants that had not progressed or died had PFS censored at the date of last follow-up.	Results	2
