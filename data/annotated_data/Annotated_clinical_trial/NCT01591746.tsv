intensity	PATO:0000049	65-74
The numeric pain intensity scale (NPIS) will be completed at the preoperative visit and again at the first postoperative visit. The NPIS is a visual analog scale (VAS) commonly used to assess clinical pain. Subjects are asked to rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.
