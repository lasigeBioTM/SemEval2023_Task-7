Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Pathologic Complete Response (pCR)	Results	1
Pathologic complete response (pCR) defined as complete absence of any viable invasive cancer cells in the resected breast and lymph nodes. Participants undergo definitive breast surgery 4 -6 weeks from last dose of FAC/FEC-regimen. Tumors removed by either lumpectomy with axillary dissection (i.e. breast conservation surgery) or modified radical mastectomy (i.e. mastectomy with axillary clearance). Surgical specimens (breast and axillary lymph node tissue) evaluated for pathological complete response.	Results	2
