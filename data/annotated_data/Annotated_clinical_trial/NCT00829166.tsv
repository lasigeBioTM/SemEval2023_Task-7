Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants With PD or Death as Assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC)	Results	1
death	OAE:0000632	38-43
PD was assessed by an IRC using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 per organ and 10 in total were identified as target lesions (TLs) and recorded at baseline. TLs should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements either by imaging or clinically. A sum of the longest diameter for all TLs was calculated as baseline sum longest diameter (SLD). All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-TLs and recorded at baseline. PD for TLs was defined as greater than or equal to (>/=) 20 percent (%) increase in SLD, taking as reference smallest SLD recorded since treatment started or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PD for non-TLs was defined as appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Percentage of Participants with PD by IRC or death from any cause was reported.
