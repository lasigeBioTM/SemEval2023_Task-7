afatinib	CHEBI:61390	10-18
In each 21 day treatment cycle, patients were administered orally afatinib tablet from Day 2 continuous daily administration in combination with trastuzumab. An initial loading dose of trastuzumab 8 mg/kg was administered via intravenous infusion at Day1 Cycle1, followed by trastuzumab 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks.

Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Afatinib in combination with trastuzumab based on the number of patients with dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first treatment cycle (Dose escalation part). The MTD was defined as the highest dose studied at which the incidence of a DLT was less than 17% (i.e. 1/6 patients) during the first cycle.	Results	2
