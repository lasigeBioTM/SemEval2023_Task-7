Pathological complete response was defined as the absence of histological evidence of invasive breast cancer cells in the tissue specimen removed from the breast after 4 cycles of preoperative treatment. Near pCR (npCR) was defined as the presence of invasive tumor cells with a size of 5 mm or less in aggregate in the tissue specimen removed from the breast after 4 cycles of preoperative treatment. Only pathological assessments occurring prior to the first date of adjuvant treatment were included in the analysis of pCR rate.	Results	2
