The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)	Results	1
symptom	OGMS:0000020	18-25
The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) evaluates severity of 13 symptoms experienced by cancer patients (pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distress, shortness of breath, difficulty remembering, decreased appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, numbness/tingling) on the scale from 0=symptom not present to 10=as bad as you can imagine. Summed symptom severity score ranging from 0 to 130 was derived. MDASI also assesses how much symptoms interfered with 6 aspects of daily life: general activity, mood, work (including work around the house), relations with other people, walking, and enjoyment of life on the scale from 0=did not interfere to 10=interfered completely. Summed interference score ranging from 0 to 60 was derived.	Results	2
