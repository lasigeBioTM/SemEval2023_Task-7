Time to disease progression (TTDP) at initial treatment was defined as the number of months between date of randomization and the date of first documented disease progression or the date of death due to disease under study, whichever came first. TTDP censored at earliest of: 1) date of death not due to disease; or 2) date of last contact for participants alive without disease progression; or 3) start date of other anti-tumor therapy; or 4) first dose date of crossover treatment.
