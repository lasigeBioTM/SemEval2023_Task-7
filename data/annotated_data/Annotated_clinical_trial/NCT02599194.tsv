Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Change From Baseline in Standard Uptake Value Maximum (SUVmax) Post-treatment	Results	1
uptake	GO:0098739,BAO:0001256	33-39
Standard Uptake Values (SUVs) for the radiotracers labels 18F-FSPG and 18F-FDG were assessed in tumor tissues of study participants, before (baseline), and after therapeutic treatment. Time frame was specified by protocol as at baseline, and at the time of clinical assessments during individual patient regular medical care. The time of the post-treatment assessment was not otherwise explicitly defined but could be anytime within 2 years. The outcome is reported as the difference of means from baseline to post-treatment (a number without dispersion), for all lesions for which an SUVmax value was assessed. A negative result indicates less uptake of radiotracer suggesting a small volume of tumor.	Results	2
