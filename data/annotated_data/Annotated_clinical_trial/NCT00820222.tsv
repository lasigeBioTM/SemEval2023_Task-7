CNS relapse is defined as the appearance of >=1 enhancing lesion measuring >=6 millimeters (mm) on T1Weighted (T1W) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) without CNS symptoms that were considered to be unequivocal based on all relevant radiological features (e.g., associated T2W signal abnormality); the appearance of any enhancing lesion on T1W MRI with CNS symptoms; unequivocal finding of leptomeningeal disease (defined as the dissemination of cancer throughout the spinal fluid), with or without symptoms; and unequivocal finding of multifocal intraparenchymal lesions with or without symptoms. In the event of the appearance of a <6 mm lesions(s) without CNS lesions, or equivocal findings potentially suggesting leptomeningeal disease, these findings were followed with a subsequent scan within 6 weeks. If unequivocal progression was determined with the subsequent scan and/or CNS symptoms occurred, then CNS relapse crieria were met.	Results	2
