Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Clinical Response	Results	1
Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all clinical evidence of disease. Partial response (PR) is a 50% or greater decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions for at least one month. No new lesions may appear, and none may increase. Minor response (MR) is a 25-49% decrease in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions. Appearance of new lesions following a PR or CR are considered relapses. Patients with progressive disease (PD) and no evidence of stable disease will be taken off study after receiving IL-2.
