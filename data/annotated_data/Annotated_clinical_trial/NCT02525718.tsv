The primary outcome measure is a well-validated and widely used survey measuring the quality of recovery from anesthesia entitled the "Global 40 Item Quality of Recovery" survey. This is a 40 question survey administered to patients to allow them to rate their quality of recovery along a number of different dimensions, including emotional state, physical comfort, psychological support, physical independence, and pain. The score ranges from 40 to 200, with 40 representing a very poor overall quality of recovery and 200 representing the best possible recovery. The following reference explains the Global 40 Item Quality of Recovery survey in detail:	Results	2
