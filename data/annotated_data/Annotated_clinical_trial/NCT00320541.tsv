Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Overall Response Rate (ORR)	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	17-21
Response defined per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR)=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease=small changes that do not meet above criteria. ORR was defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a best response of either CR or PR. ORR=number of participants with CR or PR/number of participants qualified for tumor response analysis (per-protocol population).	Results	2
