Herceptin + NeuVax Vaccine	Intervention	1
vaccine	VO:0000001	19-26
Patients randomized to this arm will receive Herceptin every 3 weeks as monotherapy for 1 year; the first Herceptin infusion will be given no sooner than 3 weeks and no later than 12 weeks after completion of standard of care chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Herceptin will be dosed at the recommended initial loading dose of 8 mg/kg and at recommended maintenance doses of 6 mg/kg q3wk. Patients will receive vaccinations of NeuVax vaccine administered intradermally every 3 weeks for 6 total vaccinations, 30-120 minutes after completion of Herceptin infusion. The NeuVax vaccine series will begin immediately after completion of the third Herceptin infusion, but may be delayed to the fourth or fifth Herceptin infusion with prior approval from the PI. After completion of primary vaccine series, patients will receive NeuVax vaccine booster inoculations to be administered every 6 months x 4 for total treatment duration of 30 months.	Intervention	2

Herceptin + GM-CSF Only	Intervention	4
Patients randomized to this arm will receive Herceptin every 3 weeks as monotherapy for 1 year. The first Herceptin infusion will be given no sooner than 3 weeks and no later than 12 weeks after completion of standard of care chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Herceptin will be dosed at the recommended initial loading dose of 8 mg/kg and at recommended maintenance doses of 6 mg/kg q3wk. Patients will receive inoculations of GM-CSF only (250mcg) administered intradermally every 3 weeks for 6 total inoculations, 30-120 minutes after completion of Herceptin infusion. The GM-CSF only inoculation series will begin immediately after completion of the third Herceptin infusion. After completion of six-inoculation primary vaccine series, patients will then receive a total of four GM-CSF only booster inoculations to be administered at 12, 18, 24, and 30 months from the date of the first Herceptin infusion.

Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Disease-free Survival (DFS)	Results	1
Disease-free survival (DFS) for all patients regardless of randomization will be determined by patients' own physicians at the individual study sites during routine follow-up screening. This will occur every three months for the first 24 months after completion of primary therapies and every six months thereafter with clinical exam, and laboratory and radiographic surveillance. The primary objective of the study is disease-free survival (DFS) at 24 months.	Results	2
