Summed Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) at 30 Minutes After Dosing (SPID30)	Results	1
pain	HP:0012531	7-11
intensity	PATO:0000049	12-21
Pain intensity was assessed by the participant using a 0-100 mm visual analog scale where 0 represented "no pain" and 100 represented "worst possible pain" at 0 (baseline, beginning of the pain episode), 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after each dose of study medication during each breakthrough pain episode. The pain intensity difference was defined as the difference in pain intensity at the various time points versus time 0 (baseline). SPID30 was calculated as the time-weighted sum of the PID scores using the following formula: SPID30=(5*PID5)+(5*PID10)+(5*PID15)+(15*PID30). The minimum and maximum SPID30 scores were -3000 and 3000. A higher score indicates less pain.	Results	2
