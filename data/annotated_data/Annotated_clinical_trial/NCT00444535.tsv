Investigator-evaluated Crude Progression-free Survival Rate After 12 Weeks of Study Treatment	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	55-59
The PFS rate is defined as the percentage of subjects who have shown no evidence of disease progression or death from any cause following 12 weeks of treatment. Disease progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.
