PF-05280014	Intervention	1
Participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer received PF-05280014 on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle followed by paclitaxel on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle both as intravenous (IV) infusions until the end of the study. The first infusion of PF-05280014 was 4 mg/kg over 90 minutes on Cycle 1 Day 1. Subsequent weekly infusions of PF-05280014 were 2 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes. Paclitaxel was administered at a dose of 80 mg/m^2 over 60 minutes. Following completion of the paclitaxel administration period and beginning no earlier than Week 33 of the study, the PF-05280014 could be changed at the discretion of the investigator to every 3 weeks at a dose of 6 mg/kg infused over 30 to 90 minutes depending on tolerability.

ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR, complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease; all target nodes must have decreased to normal size [short axis <10 mm]) or partial response (PR, >=30% decrease from baseline of the sum of diameters (SOD) of all target measurable lesions; the short diameter was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions) by Week 25 of the study and confirmed on a follow-up assessment (Week 33+/-14 days), based on the assessments of the central radiology review in accordance with RECIST 1.1.
