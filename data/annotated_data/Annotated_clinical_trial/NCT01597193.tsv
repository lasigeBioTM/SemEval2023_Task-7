Dose-Escalation Phase: Percentage of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLTs)	Results	1
DLTs were defined as any of following events related to the study drug: Any adverse event (AE) consistent with a seizure of any grade; Grade greater than equal to (>=) 3 fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting that did not improve to Grade 1 within 14 days of initiating standard of care therapy; any Grade >=3 hematologic toxicity with the following modifications: 1) Grade >=3 platelet count associated with bleeding, 2) Grade >=3 absolute neutrophil count that persists for 7 or more days or that was associated with fevers (febrile neutropenia); Grade >=3 any other non-hematological toxicity that was determined to be related to study drug.
