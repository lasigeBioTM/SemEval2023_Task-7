The primary endpoint of this study is successful surgery. Successful surgery (defined as one where the device stays in place and can be removed successfully during surgery) when this device is placed 31 - 365 days prior to surgery. Unsuccessful surgery is defined as one where the device does not stay in place and/or cannot be removed successfully during surgery) when this device is placed 31 - 365 days prior to surgery.
