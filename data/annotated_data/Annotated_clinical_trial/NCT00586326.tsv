Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Local Control Rate for Follow-up Period of 5 Years.	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	14-18
Failure of local control was defined as a histologically confirmed recurrence (invasive or non-invasive) within the prescription isodose volume. All recurrences were to have histological evaluation per the protocol; however, the case report forms did not provide space for this data to be captured. Ipsilateral axillary, infraclavicular, internal mammary, or supraclavicular recurrence or distant metastases were not considered treatment failures unless accompanied by ipsilateral breast failure.
