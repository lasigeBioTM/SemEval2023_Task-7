Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Incidence of Early Adverse Skin Reactions (EASRs)	Results	1
The Modified ONS Criteria for Radiation-Induced Acute Skin Toxicity will be used for classification of EASRs related to the skin. Participants will report in a total of 7 visits any experience with Grade I (faint or dull erythema; dry desquamation or Grade II (tender or bright erythema, patchy, moist desquamation) acute radiation dermatitis using the RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) grading system with Grade II considered the worse outcome. Comparative effectiveness will include the number or study participants in each arm that experience RTOG Grade I or Grade II radiation dermatitis and moist desquamation.	Results	2
