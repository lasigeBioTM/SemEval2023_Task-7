Response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete Response is disappearance of all clinical and laboratory signs and symptoms of disease for a minimum of 4 weeks during which no new lesions may appear. Partial Response is a minimum of 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. Stable disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started. Progressive disease is a minimum of 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new measurable lesions.
