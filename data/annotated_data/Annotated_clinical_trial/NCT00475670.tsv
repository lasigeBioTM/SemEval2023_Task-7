Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0 Guidelines	Results	1
CR was defined for target lesions (TLs) as the disappearance of all lesions, and for nontarget lesions (NTLs) as the disappearance of all nontarget nonmeasurable lesions. PR was defined for TLs as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease from baseline (BL) in the sum of longest diameter (SLD) of TLs. 95% confidence interval for one-sample binomial using Pearson-Clopper method.
