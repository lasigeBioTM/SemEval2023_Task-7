Accuracy of %Change in TOI Between Baseline and Mid-therapy to Predict Pathologic Response (pCR +/-)	Results	1
This measure will look at the Accuracy of % change in DOSI measured Tumor Optical Index (TOI) from baseline to mid therapy to predict pathologic response (pCR+ v pCR-) Pathologic response (dichotomized into responders (pCR+) and non-responders (pCR-) based pathologic assessment) will be used as the reference standard and Accuracy will be determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine the ROC Area Under the Curve (AUC).
