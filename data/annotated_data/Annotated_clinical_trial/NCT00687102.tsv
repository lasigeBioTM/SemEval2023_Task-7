The BVRT measures short term visual memory and visuo-constructional abilities. Each of 10 designs was presented one at a time for 10 seconds, and immediately after the design was withdrawn, the participant was instructed to draw it from memory on a blank sheet of paper. The score on the BVRT is the total number of errors, 0-26 represents the total number of theoretically possible errors. Lower score denotes better outcomes.	Results	3
