Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Number of Participants With Objective Response (OR)	Results	1
The Objective Response Rate. Response and progression were evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria. For the purposes of this study, patients were evaluated for response every 8 weeks. In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans were also obtained  4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.	Results	2
