Ultrasonography of the breast was used to ascertain the lump size at the beginning of therapy and a repeat Ultrasonography of breast was done after 3 months at the end of the proposed therapy to record the posttreatment lump size by the same operator. The difference between the two findings were recorded and noted and a 60% or more reduction in the size of the lump was considered as a satisfactory response.	Results	2
