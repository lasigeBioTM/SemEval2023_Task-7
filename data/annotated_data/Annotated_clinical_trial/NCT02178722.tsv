Phase 1: Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) and Serious Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events	Results	1
An adverse event is defined as the appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical condition(s) that occur after a participant provides informed consent. A TEAE is any adverse event either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event that meets 1 of the following criteria: is fatal or life threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect, is clinically meaningful (i.e. defined as an event that jeopardizes the participant or requires potential medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above) or requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.
