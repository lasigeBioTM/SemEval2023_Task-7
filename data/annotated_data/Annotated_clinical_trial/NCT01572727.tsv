Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression-free Survival (PFS)Assessed by Local Investigator's Assessment (Phase ll)	Results	1
PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the event, defined as the first radiologically documented disease progression or death due to any cause. Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.
