Pathologic Complete Response was defined as the absence of invasive cancer in the breast and lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy and reported according to the current AJCC staging system for neoadjuvant clinical studies. The endpoint was to determine the pathologic Complete Response (pCR) rates associated with weekly treatment of MM-121 plus paclitaxel followed by the combination treatment of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide compared with weekly paclitaxel alone followed by the combination treatment of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative primary breast cancer.
