Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR; Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] Version 1.1)	Results	1
Percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1 as determined by the investigator. CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all lesions. CR and PR criteria should be met again after 4 weeks and before 6 weeks after initial assessment. A two-sided confidence interval (CI) was computed using the Clopper-Pearson method.	Results	2
