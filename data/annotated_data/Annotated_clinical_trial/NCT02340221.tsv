Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (v1.1)	Results	1
PFS was defined as the time from randomization to disease progression as determined by the investigator with the use of RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred earlier. Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, including baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). For non-target lesions, disease progression was defined as unequivocal progression of existing lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression.	Results	2
