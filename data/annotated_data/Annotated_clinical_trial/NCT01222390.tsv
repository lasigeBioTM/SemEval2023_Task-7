tissue	UBERON:0000479	66-72
Contour Profile Tissue Expander: The Contour Profile Tissue Expander is a tissue expander with a greater height to width ratio than traditional tissue expanders. This increased ratio allows for greater lower pole expansion, thus creating a more natural looking, ptotic breast. Additionally, the suture tabs on the back of the expander hold the expander in place and prevent malposition and displacement.	Intervention	3

Breast Projection	Results	1
breast	UBERON:0000310	0-6
The primary outcome of interest for this study was the change in breast projection from the time of maximum tissue expander fill volume, to 3 months after the tissue expander/implant exchange surgery. Upon final fill of the tissue expander, the breast has a certain projection. Once the fully expanded tissue expander is exchanged for the permanent implant, the patients' breast projection changes gradually over time. The change in breast projection is measured in percent change of projection from baseline (the time of the final, maximum expander fill) to 3 months after the tissue expander/implant exchange surgery (at which time a change in projection has occurred).
