Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants With Overall Response Rate (ORR)	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	49-53
Overall Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of patients whose best overall response was either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.0 for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions for a period of at least one month; Partial Response (PR), >=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (ORR) = CR + PR. Only descriptive statistics.	Results	2
