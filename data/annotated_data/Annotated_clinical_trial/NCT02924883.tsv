Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Determined by Investigator's Tumor Assessment Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (v1.1)	Results	1
PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, on the basis of investigator assessments. Progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm) or the appearance of one or more new lesions.
