2-Year Treatment Discontinuation Rate	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	33-37
The 2-year treatment discontinuation rate is the percentage of participants who do not complete the palbociclib treatment per protocol for reasons due to toxicity, withdrawal of consent to be treated, or other events related to tolerability in uncensored participants. Participants who discontinued palbociclib early for reasons that were not treatment-related were censored.	Results	2
