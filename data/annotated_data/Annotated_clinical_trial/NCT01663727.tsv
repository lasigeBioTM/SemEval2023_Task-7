Tumor assessment was performed as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) by investigator. Disease progression was defined as at least 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to smallest sum of diameters on-study and absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm), unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions.
