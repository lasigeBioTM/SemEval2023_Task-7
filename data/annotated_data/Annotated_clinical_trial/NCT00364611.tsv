It is recommended that all baseline staging should be completed within 35 days prior to study entry. All subjects will have the following workup as applicable; CT scan of brain, CT scan or MRI of chest and abdomen, and bone scan or PET scan. In cases of positive bone or PET scans, bone X-ray evaluation and/or MRI is required to confirm or exclude metastatic bone disease. Subjects with metastatic disease limited to bone are ineligible unless at least one lytic lesion is measurable and can be followed by RECIST criteria.
