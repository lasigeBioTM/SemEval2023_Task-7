Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Clinical Response	Results	1
Clinical efficacy was assessed by bidimensional tumor measurements of the primary cancer at baseline, and at the end of week 6. Clinical complete response (cCR) was defined as complete disappearance of the primary tumor. Clinical partial response (cPR) was defined as a decrease by at least 50% of the sum of the products of the largest perpendicular diameters. An increase of more than 25% was defined as clinical progressive disease (cPD). Any response that does not meet the definition of cCR, cPR, or cPD was defined as stable disease (cSD).	Results	2
