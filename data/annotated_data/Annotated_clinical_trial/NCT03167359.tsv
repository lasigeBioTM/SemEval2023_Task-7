Hypofractionated Simultaneous Integrated Boost Radiotherapy: Participants will receive radiotherapy treatments to the whole breast or chest wall to a dose of 2.66 Gy per day x 15 fractions simultaneously with a boost treatment. The boost treatment will be given on the same days as the whole breast treatment. The lumpectomy cavity + scar (in lumpectomy patients) or chest wall scar (mastectomy patients) will receive 0.54 Gy per day x 15 fractions.	Intervention	3

Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Number of Participants Per Cutaneous Toxicity Grade (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)	Results	1
Cutaneous toxicity rate will be assessed by the National Cancer Institute - Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) v.3 grading scale. THe NCI CTCAE grades go from 0 to 4. Grade 0: none. Grade 1: Mild or localized; topical intervention indicated. Grade 2: Intense or widespread; intermittent; skin changes from scratching (e.g., edema, papulation, excoriations, lichenification, oozing/crusts); limiting instrumental ADLs. Grade 3-4: Severe or life-threatening. The higher the grade, the worse the outcome.	Results	2
