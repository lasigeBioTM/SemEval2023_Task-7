Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants With Clinical Objective Response (cOR) in the Breast, Evaluated by an Independent Radiological Evaluation Monitoring Committee	Results	1
breast	UBERON:0000310	73-79
cOR is defined as the documented evidence of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as assessed by ultrasound examination using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) and non-TLs and the appearance of no new lesions (NLs). PR for TLs is defined as a >=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of TLs, taking as a reference the Baseline sum LD. For non-TLs, it is defined as the persistence of >=1 non-TL and no new TLs or non-TLs.	Results	2
