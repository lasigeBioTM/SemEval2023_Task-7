The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Siemens' processing algorithm to Lorad's processing algorithm with regards to readers' diagnostic accuracy in detecting and characterizing breast lesions. The non-inferiority analyses were performed by comparing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the two algorithms & to compare false positive marks per subject.	Results	2

The ROC curve incorporates both sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) providing a single assessment incorporating both measures. It shows in a graphical way the trade-off between clinical sensitivity and specificity for every possible cut-off for a test, and gives an idea about the benefit of using the test in question. The higher the total area under the curve, the greater the predictive power of the reader assessments.	Results	3

A breast-based analysis was used for the primary AUC comparison in order to obtain additional power by having more normal/benign breasts.	Results	4

Time frame: ~1 year. Women with negative or biopsy benign findings at baseline (study entry) were followed for 1 year to confirm the negative status at 1-year follow-up mammography exam. Women diagnosed with cancer were not followed up.	Results	5
