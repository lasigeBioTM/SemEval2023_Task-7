Herceptin + Taxotere + Xeloda	Intervention	1
taxotere	CHEBI:46058	12-20
Participants received triple therapy with Herceptin, Taxotere, and Xeloda until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, or withdrawal. Herceptin and Taxotere were given via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. The first dose of Herceptin was a loading dose of 8 mg/kg in Cycle 1, and a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg was given from Cycle 2 through the end of treatment. The dose of Taxotere was 75 mg/m^2, with adjustments allowed only for toxicity. Xeloda was given orally as 950 mg/m^2 twice a day on Days 1 to 14 of each 21-day cycle, with adjustments allowed only for toxicity.	Intervention	2

Participants received dual therapy with Herceptin and Taxotere until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, or withdrawal. Treatments were given via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. The first dose of Herceptin was a loading dose of 8 mg/kg in Cycle 1, and a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg was given from Cycle 2 through the end of treatment. The dose of Taxotere was 100 mg/m^2, with adjustments allowed only for toxicity.	Intervention	5

Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)	Results	1
Tumor response was assessed by RECIST during the study. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (  ) 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. Response was to be confirmed 4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR or PR. The percentage of participants with a best overall response for CR or PR was reported. The exact 95% confidence interval (CI) for one-sample binomial was determined using the Pearson-Clopper method.	Results	2
