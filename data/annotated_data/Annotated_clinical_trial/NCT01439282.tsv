intensity	PATO:0000049	65-74
Relative Dose Intensity (RDI) is defined as the amount of drug administered over a specific time and is expressed as the fraction of that recommended for standard of care. The RDI for each participant was calculated as follows: (1) based on each participant's body surface area (BSA), a total planned dose for both eribulin (Dep) and capecitabine (Dcp) calculated for a full 4-cycle regimen; (2) actual total dose of eribulin (Dea) and capecitabine (Dca) for the full 4-cycle regimen as collected on the case report form; (3) overall RDI = (Dea/Dep + Dca/Dcp)/2. For each individual participant, the regimen was considered feasible if that participant was able to achieve an RDI of at least 85% of the 4 cycles of eribulin plus capecitabine treatment. Missing doses due to any reason was counted as zero in the RDI calculation.	Results	2
