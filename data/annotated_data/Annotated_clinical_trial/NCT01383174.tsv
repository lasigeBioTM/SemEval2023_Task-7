FACT-B was used as the breast cancer-specific quality-of-life measure. FACT-B consists of 5 subscale scores pertaining to 4 well-being dimensions (physical, social-family, emotional, functional) and additional breast cancer concerns. A total overall score is the sum of all subscales. Response options were 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much.	Results	2

Psychometric analysis in our Spanish-speaking Latina sample resulted in modifications to FACT-B: physical well-being subscale. Of 7 items, 1 was dropped because it was conceptually different from other items on that scale. Modified subscale was scored by summing items. Possible score ranges for physical well-being were 0-24. Higher scores indicated greater well-being.	Results	3
