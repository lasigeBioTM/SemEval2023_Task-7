INTERVENTION 1:	Intervention	0
All Study Participants: Patient Assisted Compression	Intervention	1
patient	HADO:0000008,OAE:0001817	24-31
All subjects will undergo standard of care imaging on one breast. The other breast will be imaged using Patient-Assisted Compression (PAC), followed by Technologist-controlled (TC) Compression.	Intervention	2
breast	UBERON:0000310	58-64
breast	UBERON:0000310	76-82
Patient-Assisted Compression (PAC): The technologist will properly position the breast and apply minimum compression. The subject will be instructed to apply compression as the technologist ensures the breast tissue is in appropriate position and tautness. The technologist will then guide the subject to achieve appropriate compression level, sufficient but not excessive, and the image will be acquired. This will be done for both standard views CC & MLO.	Intervention	3
