Nab-Paclitaxel/Bevacizumab/Trastuzumab	Intervention	1
Patients received treatment with nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8, 15) and carboplatin (AUC 6 IV day 1) every 28 days for 6 cycles. Trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 2 mg/kg) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV) were administered weekly for 23 weeks, beginning concurrently with chemotherapy. Patients then underwent either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery and pathologic treatment responses were assessed. After surgery, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg were administered at 3 week intervals for a total of 52 weeks.	Intervention	2
