Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Change in Serum 25(OH)D	Results	1
Change in laboratory serum value of 25(OH)D at 8 weeks post-supplementation for participants who received weekly supplementation of 50,000 IUs of vitamin D3. Change is expressed as laboratory serum value of 25(OH)D at 8 weeks minus baseline. Change was not assessed for participants in the 'no cholecalciferol' arm since they did not receive weekly supplementation and were not followed over time.	Results	2
