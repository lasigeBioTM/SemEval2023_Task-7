Average change in hot flash activity score from baseline to Week 7 for Low Dose Oxybutynin vs Placebo. The hot flash activity will be measured by the weekly average hot flash score (Sloan JA, et. al., 2001), which is a composite entity of both frequency and severity of hot flashes (The Hot Flash Diary collects the following information for Day 1- Day 7 of each week: Number of mild hot flashes, Number of moderate hot flashes, Number of severe hot flashes, Number of very severe hot flashes). This is a count, so it can range from 0 to infinity.	Results	2
