One of the primary outcomes of this study was to measure the impact of weekly chloroquine on the amount of DCIS seen on MRI.The tumor response was evaluated by RECIST criteria. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), >=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR The longest diameter of the target lesion or primary area of non-mass enhancement was measured by digital calipers. For one patient, the longest diameter was difficult to measure due to the presence of a significant post biopsy resolving hematoma at the biopsy site. Further correlation was made based on the extent of the pre-treatment microcalcifications and post treatment areas of non-mass enhancement.	Results	2
