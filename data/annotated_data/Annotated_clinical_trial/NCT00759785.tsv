Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants Demonstrating a Decrease in the Growth Factor Signature (GFS)	Results	1
growth factor	BAO:0002024	59-72
GFS was measured by microarray analysis of the entire 101 gene signature expression. The GFS is quantified as the change in gene expression between two separate samples collected from the same participant. A log (base 10) ratio of expression in the post-dose sample was generated relative to the reference in both the Up and DOWN arms of the gene signature. A log ratio value of zero indicated no change in the expression between the two samples. GFS was calculated as the mean log ratio of genes in the UP arm minus mean log ratio of genes in the Down arm. GFS was compared for paired samples (pre-dose and post-dose) by a T-statistic calculated as the GFS divided by its standard error. Responders to therapy had a T-statistic that was smaller than the threshold 1st percentile of student's T-distribution and were counted as having a decrease in GFS.	Results	2
