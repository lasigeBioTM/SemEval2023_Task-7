Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Diagnostic Yield	Results	1
Diagnostic yield is the likelihood that a test or procedure will provide the information needed to establish a diagnosis. In this case, it is the proportion of women with positive results of a screening test and positive results with the reference standard (verified cancer status).	Results	2
