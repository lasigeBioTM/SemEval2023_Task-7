Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT): Part 1 Phase 1	Results	1
DLT was classified as per common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 4.0 as any of the events occurring during 28 days of Cycle 1,attributed to study drug:grade 4 neutropenia(for a duration of greater than [>]7 days); febrile neutropenia (grade greater than or equal to [>=]3 neutropenia,body temperature >=38.5 degree Celsius);grade >=3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding episode;grade 4 thrombocytopenia;grade >=3 non-hematologic toxicity except grade 3 or more nausea, vomiting,electrolyte abnormality(if controllable by therapy);grade 3 QTc prolongation(>500 millisecond [msec])persist after correction of reversible cause such as electrolyte abnormalities or hypoxia. Lack of hematologic recovery (platelets less than [<]50,000/microliter [mcL],absolute neutrophil count <1,000/mcL,hemoglobin <8.0 gram/deciliter [g/dL]) or prolonged non hematologic toxicities that delays initiation of next dose by >7 days;receipt of <75 percent of planned dose in first cycle due to toxicity.
