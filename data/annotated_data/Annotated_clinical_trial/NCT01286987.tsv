Number of Participants With Objective Response	Results	1
Objective response in participants was defined as the number of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after treatment with talazoparib and maintained for at least 4 weeks (28 days) as assessed by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR defined as disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions (where all target lesions were recorded with a length of 0 millimeter [mm] on the case report form [CRF]) and the reduction of the shortest diameter of all nodal lesions to less than [<] 10 mm. PR was defined by a 30% or more decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) + sum of shortest diameters (SSD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD+SSD.	Results	2
