Picture Option Grid: The Picture Option Grid was derived from the Option Grid for early stage breast cancer. It uses the same evidence and integrates images and simpler text, thus exploiting pictorial superiority. The Picture Option Grid has been specifically designed for women of lower SES and low health literacy.	Intervention	7

Change in Decision Quality: Knowledge Subscale	Results	1
quality	BAO:0002928,BFO:0000019	19-26
Change in decision quality, measured using the validated 16-item Decision Quality Worksheet for Breast Cancer Surgery. Decision quality is measured through three constructs: knowledge, decision process, and concordance. Knowledge is five questions that results in a score from 0 to 5 with higher numbers indicating higher knowledge. Decision process is a measure how much shared decision making process occurred, based on patient-report. It is a seven-item scale with higher numbers indicating higher shared decision process. For the concordance score, patients rated their goals and concerns on an 11-point importance scale from 0 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). They also indicated which surgery they intended to have at T2. A concordance summary score (0-100%) indicated the percentage of patients who received a treatment that matched their stated preference.
