Selected scales (communication and interpersonal style) of the Interpersonal Processes of Care Survey will be the primary outcome. A total of 18 (corrected from orginal submission) questions will be administered. The questions are scored on a scale from 1-5 with higher scores indicating higher frequencies of the construct. The compiled scores will range from 5-90. Scales with negative associations (discrimination, hurried communication) will be reversed. Thus, higher scores for all items will indicate a more positive experience.	Results	2
