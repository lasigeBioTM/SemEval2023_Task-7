Arm I - PANVAC + Docetaxel	Intervention	1
Patients receive vaccinia-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)- mucin-1 (MUC-1)- triad of costimulatory molecules (TRICOM) vaccine subcutaneously (SC) once and sargramostim, or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) SC once daily for 4 days in week -2. Patients also receive fowlpox-CEA-MUC-1-TRICOM vaccine SC once and GM-CSF SC once daily for 4 days in weeks 1, 5, and 9. Patients also receive docetaxel intravenous (IV) over 30 minutes once weekly in weeks 1-3, 5-7, and 9-11. After week 12, patients with no disease progression continue with docetaxel once weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest and fowlpox-CEA-MUC-1-TRICOM vaccine plus GM-CSF every 4 weeks until disease progression.
