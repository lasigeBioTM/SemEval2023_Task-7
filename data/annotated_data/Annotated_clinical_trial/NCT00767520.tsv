exemestane	CHEBI:4953	49-59
exemestane	CHEBI:4953	78-88
PFS= The time (weeks) from date of randomization to date of progressive disease(PD). PFS for each randomization arm was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. A point estimate and a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the median PFS was computed for each randomization arm using the Brookmeyer & Crowley method. PD=Increase ( 20%) in sum of longest diameters from smallest value during study (including baseline).	Results	2
