For each sample, the ER H-score is calculated from the percentage of cells staining very weak (+/-); weak (+); moderate (++); or strong (+++) as follows: H-score = [(0.5 x percent +/-) + (1 x percent +) + (2 x percent ++) + (3 x percent +++)]. Range 0-300. The greater the change from baseline (randomization) in ER H-score, the greater the blockage of ER expression and the greater the potential anti-tumour activity. Percentage change from baseline=[(SRG - BL)/BL]x100	Results	2
