imiquimod	CHEBI:36704	22-31
Tumor responses will be determined using the sum of the products of the largest perpendicular dimensions. Target lesions will be evaluated by the following response criteria: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD).	Results	2
