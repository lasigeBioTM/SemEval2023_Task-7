Number of Participants With Clinical Benefit (CBR) and Number of Participants With CBR Having a Disease Free Interval (DFI) Greater Than 2 Years - Evaluable Population	Results	1
disease	DOID:4,OGMS:0000031	96-103
CBR=participants with complete response (CR) + participants with partial response (PR) + participants with stable disease (SD) for a length of time greater than, equal to 6 months. CR= Disappearance of all target lesions. No new lesions. PR= At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. SD= Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. Physical examination,radiological assessment, and bone scans (if applicable) were used to assess outcome.	Results	2
