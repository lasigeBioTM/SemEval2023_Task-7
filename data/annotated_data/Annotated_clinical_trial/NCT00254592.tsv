In calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is done is considered Day 0. Therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the Monday four weeks later would be considered Day 28. This allows for efficient patient scheduling without exceeding the guidelines. If Day 28 or 42 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may be extended to the next working day.	Eligibility	10

Overall Clinical Response to the Dose Dense Regimen	Results	1
Measure clinical response rates in patients with breast cancer more than 2 cm and/or lymph node positive breast cancer treated with 2- 4 cycles of biweekly doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide with GMCSF (day 4-13) followed by weekly carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel given for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest, for a total of 9-12 doses.
