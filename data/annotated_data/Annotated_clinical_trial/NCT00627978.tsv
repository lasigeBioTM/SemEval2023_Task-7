morphology	PATO:0000051	20-30
Digital photographs for morphometry were captured at a magnification of 8000-16,000x and the photos were uploaded onto an imaging platform of transmission electron microscope (iTEM) (Olympus, MuÂ¨nster, Germany). The figures were enlarged by 50%, and an individual linear array was used to measure the axonal diameter (cross-sectional area) and the number of unmyelinated axons per Remak Schwann cell was enumerated according to the established methodology.
