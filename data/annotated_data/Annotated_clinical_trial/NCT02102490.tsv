Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Objective Response Rate [ORR])	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	100-104
ORR was the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions.
