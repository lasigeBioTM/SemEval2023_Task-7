Confirmed Response Rate	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	19-23
A confirmed tumor response is defined to be either a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) noted as the objective status on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 6 weeks apart. All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form and initiated study medication will be evaluable for response. The proportion of confirmed tumor responses will be estimated by the number of tumor regressions that meet the RECIST criteria for a confirmed CR or PR divided by the total number of evaluable patients. A 95% confidence interval for the true confirmed response rate will be calculated using the properties of the binomial distribution. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), >=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.
