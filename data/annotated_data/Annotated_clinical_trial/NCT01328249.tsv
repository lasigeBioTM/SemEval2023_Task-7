Cohort 1: Eribulin Mesylate With Filgrastim as Needed	Intervention	1
eribulin mesylate	CHEBI:70710	10-27
Participants initially received doxorubicin (60 mg/m^2) plus cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m^2) intravenously (IV) on Day 1, of every 14-day cycle for 4 cycles. Eribulin mesylate was administered following the doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide regimen at a dose of 1.4 mg/m^2 IV over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle for 4 cycles (Cycles 5 to 8). In this Cohort growth factors, subcutaneous pegfilgrastim (6 mg) or filgrastim, could be used with eribulin therapy at the physician's discretion if neutropenia occurred that recovered to Grade 2.

Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or beta-human chorionic gonadotropin serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. A urine pregnancy test should be repeated prior to chemotherapy if not conducted within 72 hours of start of treatment. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or to use a highly effective method of contraception (e.g., condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), or have a vasectomized partner) having started for at least one menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug and throughout the entire study period and for 30 days (longer if appropriate) after the last dose of study drug. Perimenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential. Male subjects who are not abstinent or who have undergone a successful vasectomy, who are partners of women of childbearing potential must use, or their partners must use, a highly effective method of contraception (e.g., condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide, IUD) starting for at least one menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug and throughout the entire study period and for 30 days (longer if appropriate) after the last dose of study drug. Subjects with partners using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (as described previously).	Eligibility	10

Percentage of Participants With Feasibility	Results	1
The regimen was considered feasible if the participant was able to complete the eribulin portion without dose delay or reduction. Dose delay was defined as a delay due to eribulin-related adverse event (AE) for more than 2 days for subsequent doses (cycles after the initiation of full dose of eribulin, except holidays, scheduling difficulties and nonclinical logistical issues). If a participant had more than 1 dose omission, delay or reduction due to eribulin-related AE, these events were collectively counted as one entity in the same participant. Participants were followed for approximately 3 years after the last dose of the study treatment. Feasibility rates were calculated with or without growth factor support. In both cohorts, the percentage of participants who completed the eribulin portion of the regimen without a dose omission, delay or reduction due to eribulin-related AE was estimated via the observed completion rate and an exact 90% confidence interval (CI) was constructed.
