disease	DOID:4,OGMS:0000031	107-114
rate	BAO:0080019	144-148
Clinical benefit rate is defined as the rate of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, and SD for 24 weeks duration and is the best response CR, PR, or SD as classified by the investigators according to the RECIST v1.1. CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of not-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started. Kaplan-Meier (KM) techniques were used to assess the time-to-event endpoints. Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as having at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and minimum 5 mm increase above nadir.	Results	2
