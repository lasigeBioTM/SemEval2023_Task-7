everolimus	CHEBI:68478	68-78
exemestane	CHEBI:4953	50-60
Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first radiologically documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient did not have an event, PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment. PFS was compared between the everolimus + exemestane combination therapy with the everolimus monotherapy.	Results	2
