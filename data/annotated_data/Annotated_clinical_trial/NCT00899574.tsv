Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Objective Response (Complete Clinical Response+ Partial Response)	Results	1
This is defined as percentage of patients who achieved complete clinical response or partial response at end of cycle 1 of treatment. The tumor size will be measured as lesion surface area (region of interest, ROI). The response to the treatment is then evaluated as a function of post-treatment over pre-treatment ROI, expressed in percentage. Response criteria for this study are based on European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer definitions for chest wall tumors: complete clinical response: absence of any detectable residual disease; partial response: <50% of ROI change.
