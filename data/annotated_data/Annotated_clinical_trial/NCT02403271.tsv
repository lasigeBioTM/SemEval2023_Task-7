Phase 1b	Intervention	1
In the Phase 1b (safety portion) of the study, a starting dose of 560 mg of ibrutinib and 10 mg/kg of MEDI4736 will be explored and will follow a 6 + 3 dose de-escalation design and will include a sentinel participant which will have a 3-day observation period prior to dosing of subsequent participants. Participants with one of the following three tumor types will be eligible for enrollment: NSCLC (adenocarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma), breast cancer (triple-negative and HER2-positive cancer), and Pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma).
