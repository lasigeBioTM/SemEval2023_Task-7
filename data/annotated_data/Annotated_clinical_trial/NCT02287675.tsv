Lymphoseek	Intervention	1
Lymphoseek (technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept) Injection is indicated for lymphatic mapping with a hand-held gamma counter to assist in the localization of lymph nodes draining a primary tumor site in patients with breast cancer or melanoma and guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy using a hand-held gamma counter in patients with clinically node negative squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.

Injection Site Clearance for Lymphoseek and 99mTc-Sulfur Colloid (SC).	Results	1
injection site	VO:0000300	0-14
The rate of injection site clearance is the time from radiotracer injection to peak SLN radioactive level. Injection clearance rates will be determined by planar SPECT imaging and by SPECT/CT. Subjects will undergo standard sequential planar imaging at 30 to 60 seconds intervals until the sentinel lymph node is seen. Once a sentinel node is located, a SPECT/CT will be performed for higher resolution imaging in transaxial, coronal, and sagittal planes.	Results	2
