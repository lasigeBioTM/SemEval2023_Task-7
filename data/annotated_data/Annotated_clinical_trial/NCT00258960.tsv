Objective Response Rate (ORR)	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	19-23
ORR is the sum of the Complete Responses (CR) and Partial Responses (PR) according to the RECIST criteria, experienced for each patient during treatment (recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression). Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), >=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response Rate (ORR) = CR + PR.
