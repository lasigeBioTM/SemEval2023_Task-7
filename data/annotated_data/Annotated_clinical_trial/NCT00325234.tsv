For CR or PR, best response must be confirmed. A second assessment performed at 28 days. Two determinations of CR before progression required for rate to=CR. Evaluations include: CR=Disappearance of lesions. PR=  30% size decrease of lesions. Progressive Disease (PD)=  20% size increase of lesions. Stable Disease (SD)=Not enough shrinkage for PR nor enough increase for PD. Overall Response Rate=PR+CR/Qualified Participants*100.	Results	2
