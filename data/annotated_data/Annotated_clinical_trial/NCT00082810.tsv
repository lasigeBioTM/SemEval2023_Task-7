Number of participants met the definition of Clinical Benefit Rate.Tumor response was assessed every three cycles by CT using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) criteria. Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0) for target lesions: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.
