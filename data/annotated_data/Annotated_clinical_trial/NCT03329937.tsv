Niraparib 200 mg	Intervention	1
niraparib	CHEBI:176844	0-9
Participants received niraparib 200 milligrams (mg) orally once daily in 28-day treatment cycles. After 2 cycles, participants either underwent surgery, received additional cycles of niraparib (maximum of 6 cycles total), or received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, at physician's discretion. A breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at the end of cycle 2 and breast ultrasounds were performed at the end of each cycle, including any additional cycles beyond cycle 2. After completion of all neoadjuvant therapy participants proceeded to surgery, at which time pathological complete response (pCR) was assessed.	Intervention	2

Percentage of Participants With Tumor Response Measured by Breast MRI	Results	1
breast	UBERON:0000310	59-65
Tumor response measured by breast MRI is defined as >=30 percent (%) reduction of tumor volume from Baseline based on primary lesion after niraparib treatment without any new lesion development. Tumor volume was calculated as (length × width × height × pi [π])/6. Responses were assessed as Clinical complete response (CR): A complete disappearance of all tumor signs in the breast as assessed by imaging test. Clinical partial response (PR): A reduction in the tumor volume of the primary tumor size by >=30% assessed by palpation or imaging test. Clinical stable disease (SD): No significant change in tumor volume during treatment. Clinical progressive disease (cPD): The development of new, previously undetected lesions, or an estimated increase in the size of the primary lesion by greater than 20%. Percentage of participants with tumor response and its 95 percent confidence interval (CI) has been presented. The 95% CI was the binomial exact CI based on Clopper-Pearson method.	Results	2
