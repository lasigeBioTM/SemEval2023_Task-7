Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Maximum-tolerated Dose (Phase I)	Results	1
MTD is defined as the dose level below the lowest dose that induces dose limiting toxicity in at least one-third of patients (at least 2 of a maximum of 6> new patients). If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is not seen in any of the 3 patients, 3 new patients will be accrued and treated at the next higher dose level. If DLT are seen in 2 or 3 of 3 patients treated at a given dose level, then the next 3 patients will be treated at the next lower dose level, if only 3 patients were enrolled and treated at this lower dose level. The number of DLT's will be reported here.	Results	2
