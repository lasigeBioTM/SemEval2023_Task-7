The MTD of dasatinib (taken daily, continuously) when given in combination with ixabepilone (administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle) was determined using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation cohort design. The total sample and the number of patients who receive each dose in this design depends on the frequency of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) at each dosage. The MTD was defined as the dose at which  1 of 6 patients experienced DLT, and above which  2 of 6 patients experienced DLT.	Results	2
