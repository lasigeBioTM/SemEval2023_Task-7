Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) (Calliper)	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	22-26
The BORR were defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed CR or PR in the ITT population during 24 weeks pre-operative treatment period (based on the data from calliper measurement).	Results	2
CR (or PR) criteria are met at 2 or more time in points every 4 weeks. Per RECIST Criteria (V1.0) and assessed by Calliper: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), >= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.
