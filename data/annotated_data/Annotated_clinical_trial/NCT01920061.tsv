Arm A1: 90 mg PF-05212384 + Docetaxel	Intervention	1
Participants with castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), advanced breast cancer (ABC), or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that were candidates to treatment with a docetaxel-based combination. Each treatment cycle was defined as 21 days. Participants received intravenous infusion of PF-05212384 90 mg once on Day -7 and Cycle 1 Day 2, and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 1-hour IV infusion once on Cycle 1 Day 1. On Day 1 for Cycles 2 and beyond, participants received docetaxel 75 mg/m2 1-hour IV infusion once followed by PF-05212384 90 mg once. The maximum duration of PF-05212384 treatment was 505 days and the maximum duration of docetaxel treatment was 445 days.	Intervention	2

Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) - Arms A, B and C	Results	1
DLT was defined as any of the following adverse events (AEs) attributable to the combination: (1) hematologic: grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days; febrile neutropenia; grade >=3 neutropenia with infection; grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; grade 4 thrombocytopenia; (2) non-hematologic: grade >=2 pneumonitis; grade>=3 toxicities, except pneumonitis, and excluding those that had not been maximally treated; persistent, intolerable toxicities which resulted in the failure to deliver at least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 for Arms A and B or at least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 and 75% of dacomitinib for Arm C during the first cycle; the persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in delay of the start of the second cycle by more than 2 weeks relative to the scheduled start; in an asymptomatic participant, the grade 3 QTc prolongation persists after correction of any reversible causes.
