Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (Quest Diagnostics). Persistently elevated serum estradiol level outside the post-menopausal range was defined as: Serum estradiol >10 pg/dl on two consecutive collections at least 4 weeks apart. 2. If baseline estradiol was >10 pg/dl, subsequent levels >10 pg/ml higher than baseline were considered a significant elevation outside the post-menopausal range.	Results	2
