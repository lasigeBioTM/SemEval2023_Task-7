Afatinib + Vinorelbine (AV)	Intervention	1
afatinib	CHEBI:61390	0-8
vinorelbine	CHEBI:480999	11-22
Participants received oral treatment of film-coated Afatinib tablet at a starting dose of 40 milligram (mg) once daily and weekly 10 minutes intravenous infusion of Vinorelbine 25 mg/meter^2 (meter=m) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each course. The treatment was administered in treatment courses of 28 days. For Afatinib, a protocol-defined dose-reduction scheme was to be followed if a participant experienced certain pre-specified adverse events. From 26 April 2013, any participant who had been randomised to the AV arm stopped treatment, had the option to switch to Trastuzamb + Vinorelbine.	Intervention	2

Progression-free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
PFS is defined as time from randomisation to disease progression or death whichever occurs first. Assessed by investigator according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1). RECIST is a set of published rules that define when tumors in cancer patients improve ("respond"), stay the same ("stabilize") or worsen ("progress") during treatment.	Results	2
