Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to World Health Organization (WHO) Handbook for Reporting Results of Cancer Treatment	Results	1
cancer	DOID:162	164-170
For measurable disease, CR was defined as the disappearance of all clinically detectable disease determined by 2 observations not less than 4 weeks apart; and PR was defined as a 50 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the products of the 2 greatest diameters of all measurable lesions by 2 observations not less than 4 weeks apart, and no appearance of new lesions or progression of any lesion. For immeasurable disease, CR was defined as the complete disappearance of all known disease for at least 4 weeks; and PR was defined as an estimated decrease in tumor size of 50% or more for at least 4 weeks.
