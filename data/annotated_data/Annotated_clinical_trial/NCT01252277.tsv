Inclusion Criteria	Eligibility	0
Subjects must be premenopausal and between the ages of 25 and 54 and must have had a menstrual period within the past 12 months. Women who are not menstruating regularly due to use of certain types of contraceptives may be entered with restrictions. Their estrogen progesterone, and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels must be documented at baseline random periareolar fine needle aspiration (RPFNA) and their off study RPFNA must take place at a similar portion of their cycle (high or low progesterone levels). In order to do this a serum progesterone will have to be obtained ~ 4 weeks before planned RPFNA and again 2 weeks later such that the RPFNA can be performed in the same phase of the "cycle" as baseline.

Inclusion of Women and Minorities	Eligibility	29
-This study utilizes women at increased risk for breast cancer. Subjects recruited from an established cohort of women followed in the Breast Cancer Prevention Center.

Males are not included due to the low absolute risk of breast cancer, and the difficulty of performing RPFNA on the male breast.	Eligibility	30
