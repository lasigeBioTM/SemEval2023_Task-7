The primary outcome is severity of the most bothersome vaginal symptom: dryness or dyspareunia. The Vaginal Symptom Measure (VSM) was used to evaluate the severity of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. The VSM uses a 5- point ordinal response scale; 1="none", 2="mild", 3="moderate", 4="severe" and 5="very severe" to measure the severity associated with vaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia. For each patient, the change in severity was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the week 12 reported score. Therefore, the full range of scores ranges from -4 (greatest decrease in severity) to 4 (greatest increase in severity). A negative score indicates a decrease in severity from baseline, zero indicates no reported affect and positive scores indicate a more severe report at week 12. The primary assessment method will be a comparison of the averages of the changes over time in the severity items for the most bothersome symptom from baseline to 12 weeks (as indicated at baseline).
