PhysioTouch: The PhysioTouch is a hand-held device that administers negative pressure under the treatment head, and gently pulls the underlying skin and subcutaneous tissue into the suction cup. This suction produces a stretch to the skin and in the subcutaneous tissue space. This action is thought to facilitate lymphatic flow from the interstitium into the lymphatic vessels, and mobilizes the superficial fascia.	Intervention	7
