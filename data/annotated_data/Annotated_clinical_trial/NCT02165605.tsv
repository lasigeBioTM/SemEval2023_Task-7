INTERVENTION 1:	Intervention	0
HylaCare	Intervention	1
Each patient will be randomized blindly as to whether the study serum will be applied to the medial or lateral portion of the treated breast, using the nipple as the dividing line. The product and placebo will also be applied to the contra-lateral breast in the same fashion, as a further control. The study drug and placebo will be applied three times daily, but not within four hours prior to radiation treatment. Each patient will use both HA study cream and placebo.	Intervention	2
