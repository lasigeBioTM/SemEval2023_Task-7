Entire Study Population	Intervention	1
Because a paired study design was used (only bilateral procedures), each subject served as her own control. Randomization assigned which side (right or left) would receive the antisepsis interventions, and the contralateral side received standard drain care.	Intervention	2

Number of Subjects With Drain Bulb Fluid Bacterial Colonization at Approximately 1 Week	Results	1

Bacterial growth was defined as plate growth of 1+ or greater. Drains were removed at variable times across patients, per clinical indication. When clinically indicated, some patients did have their drains removed at the one week visit, in which case they only had one bulb fluid culture.	Results	2
