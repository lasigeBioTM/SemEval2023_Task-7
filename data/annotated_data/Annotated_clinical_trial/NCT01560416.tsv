Arm B participants whose disease was at a minimum stable could elect to discontinue ganetespib after 6 cycles or stay on combination treatment until disease progression. Otherwise, Arm B participants taken off ganetespib for toxicity were to remain on single agent fulvestrant until disease progression.	Intervention	6

Progression-Free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
PFS based on Kaplan-Meier is defined as the time from study entry to the earliest documentation of disease progression (PD) or death. Participants alive without evidence of PD are censored at the date of last disease assessment. Participants who receive non-protocol anti-cancer therapy before disease progression are censored at time of last disease assessment.	Results	2
