Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) + Stable Disease (SD)  12 weeks of selinexor in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions; PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.
