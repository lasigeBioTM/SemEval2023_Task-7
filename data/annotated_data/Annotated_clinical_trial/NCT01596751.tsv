breast cancer	DOID:1612	121-134
The MTD was determined using a standard dose-escalation schema with 3 to 6 participants per cohort (3+3 design) for participants enrolled in Phase 1b. The starting dose level of PLX3397 was 600 mg/day and was raised in successive cohorts up to a dose of 1000 mg/day. Participants in each Phase Ib cohort were followed for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) within the first 21 days of combination therapy and had to receive at least 14 days of PLX3397 and 2 doses of eribulin during the first cycle in order to be considered evaluable for DLT (unless the missed doses were due to a DLT). A toxicity was considered a DLT if it was treatment related and met specific requirements for type of toxicity and severity assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4. The MTD was defined as the lowest dose level at which 2 or more participants in a cohort experienced a DLT. The dose level just below the MTD was selected for Phase 2.	Results	2
