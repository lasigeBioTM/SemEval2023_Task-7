Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). As per modified RECIST v1.1, CR: disappearance of all target lesions, PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.
