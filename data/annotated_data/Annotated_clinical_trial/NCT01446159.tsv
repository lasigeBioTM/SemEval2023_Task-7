Phase 1b and Phase 2: Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs)	Results	1
An Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with use of study drug, whether or not considered related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event. TEAEs and TESAEs are defined as AEs and SAEs present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug, or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug, up to 60 days after the last study drug or until the participants started another anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first (approximately 8 years).
