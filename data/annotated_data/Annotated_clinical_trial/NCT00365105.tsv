Median time to development of a malignant skeletal related event (SRE), which is defined as a pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone or radiation to bone is estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. The time of failure was measured from date of randomization to the date of a documented SRE. The analysis was planned to occur after 257 SRE have been observed, unless the criteria for early stopping are met.	Results	2
