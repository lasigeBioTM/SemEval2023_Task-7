All staging studies including physical exam, chest x-ray, and bone scan had to show no evidence of metastatic disease, including suspicious lymphadenopathy or skin nodules on physical exam. A chest x-ray and bone scan were mandatory; however, all other staging studies were at the treating physician's discretion. Any other staging test (eg, Computed Tomography [CT] scans, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] studies, ultrasound of abdomen, Positron Emission Tomography [PET] scans must have been negative for metastatic disease. An abdominal CT scan or PET scan was mandatory for patients with liver function tests elevated above the upper limit of normal (ULN) to rule out metastatic disease. If the patient had a staging PET scan then a bone scan was not necessary, but a chest x-ray was required.	Eligibility	27
