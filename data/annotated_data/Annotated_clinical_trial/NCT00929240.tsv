Maintenance Phase: Bevacizumab	Intervention	1
During the Initial Phase all participants received bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each 3 week cycle for a minimum of 3 cycles and a maximum of 6 cycles or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or participant request for withdrawal, whichever occurred first along with docetaxel, a recommended dose of 100 mg/m^2 IV administered on Day 1 of each cycle. Doses of 75 to 100 mg/m^2 of docetaxel could be administered at investigator's discretion. At the end of the Initial Phase, participants with an objective response (PR or CR) or SD received 15 mg/kg bevacizumab IV on Day 1 of each 3 week cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, participant request for withdrawal or end of study, whichever occurred first.

During the Initial Phase participants received bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each 3 week cycle for a minimum of 3 cycles and a maximum of 6 cycles or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal, whichever occurred first, along with docetaxel, a recommended dose of 100 mg/m^2 IV administered on Day 1 of each cycle. Doses of 75 to 100 mg/m^2 of docetaxel could be administered at investigator's discretion. At the end of the Initial Phase, participants with an objective response were randomized to receive bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m^2 twice daily on Days 1 to 14 of each 3 week cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, request for withdrawal or end of study, whichever occurred first. If one of the drugs was discontinued before disease progression, treatment was continued with the second drug until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal or end of study, whichever occurred first.

Progression Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from first study drug dosing (during the maintenance treatment phase) to the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Progression was based on tumor assessment made by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as a 20 percent (%) or greater increase in the sum of the Longest Diameter (LD) of the target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded or appearance of new lesions.
