Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Disease-free Survival (DFS)	Results	1
It is defined as the months from the day of randomization to the earliest date when a recurrence of the primary disease (recurrence in the breast, chest wall and nodal sites or the development of metastatic disease) or a contralateral breast cancer was observed. Subjects who died without recurrence of the primary disease or the development of the contralateral breast cancer were censored at their death date. If a patient has not recurred, developed a contralateral breast cancer, or died, disease-free survival was censored on the date of the last day the patient was known to be alive. Probability of disease free survival at 5 years is estimated and reported.	Results	2
