Progression-Free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
PFS was defined as time from randomization until the first evidence of progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) or death from any cause; by Investigator assessment. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since baseline, progression in non-target lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesion(s). Participants who neither progressed nor died were censored the day of their last radiographic tumor assessment if available or date of randomization if no post initiation radiographic assessment was available. If death or PD occurred after 2 missing radiographic visits, censoring occurred at date of the last radiographic visit prior to the missed visits. The symptomatic/clinical disease progression (deterioration) without documented radiologic progression did not constitute progression.	Results	2
