Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants With an Objective Overall Response	Results	1
Objective overall response is complete response (CR) + partial response (PR), as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. It is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants treated multiplied by 100.	Results	2
