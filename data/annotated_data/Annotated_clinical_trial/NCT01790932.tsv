Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Clinical Benefit Rate	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	17-21
Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for 4 months or longer based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions (smallest sum LD reference), new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable disease (SD) is defined as any condition not meeting the above criteria.	Results	2
