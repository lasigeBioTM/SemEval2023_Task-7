Clinical benefit rate is defined as the number of patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) that lasts at least 6 months. Response was assessed every 2 cycles of treatment (6 weeks) by computed tomography (CT), CT/positron emission tomography (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Overall response evaluation is based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.0 (RECIST 1.0). Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), >=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.
