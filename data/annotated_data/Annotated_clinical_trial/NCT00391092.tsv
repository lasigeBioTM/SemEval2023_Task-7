Trastuzumab + Docetaxel	Intervention	1
Trastuzumab 8 mg/kg loading dose administered intravenously on Day 1 of Cycle 1, followed by docetaxel 100 mg/m^2 on Day 2 of Cycle 1. Then a maintenance dose of trastuzumab at 6 mg/kg and docetaxel at 100 mg/m^2 were administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 3-weekly cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity (requiring discontinuation of study treatment), or withdrawal of participant's consent, and for a minimum of 6 cycles, respectively.

Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression Free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
PFS was defined as the time from randomization to time of first documented disease progression (unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions) or death, whichever occurred first as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0 (RECIST v1.0). Progressive disease is defined using RECIST v1.0 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started. Primary PFS variable was defined based on the investigators' assessments and the statistical conclusions on the primary efficacy endpoint were based on investigator assessed PFS. PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.	Results	2
