Number of participants experiencing CR, PR or SD as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Response is anyone who experiences SD, CR or PR in first 6 months. CR: Disappearance clinical evidence active tumor by evaluation, mammogram & ultrasound. No symptoms or evidence of residual invasive tumor, including no residual tumor in axillary lymph nodes. PR: 50%/> decrease for minimum 4 weeks in measurable lesion determined by product of perpendicular diameters of lesion. Every lesion should not regress to qualify as PR; however, if lesion progresses or if new lesions appear, response cannot be classified as PR. Minor Response [MR]: Decreases in tumor masses insufficient to qualify as partial remission, i.e. <50%. SD: Between MR & PD. PD: Increase 25% measured lesion from baseline. New lesions constitutes increasing disease. Mixed responses consid	Results	2
