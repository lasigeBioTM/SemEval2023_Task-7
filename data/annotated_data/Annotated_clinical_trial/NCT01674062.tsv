Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab (Cohorts 1 and 2)	Intervention	1
Females with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer received dual-agent treatment with pertuzumab and trastuzumab. Recruitment for Cohorts 1 and 2 was conducted separately; however, the same regimen was administered to both sets of participants. Trastuzumab was administered via IV infusion as 2 mg/kg once weekly, or as 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Pertuzumab was administered via IV infusion at a loading dose of 840 mg followed by a standard dose of 420 mg every 3 weeks, beginning on Day 2 of Cycle 1. Thereafter, both medications were administered on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Treatment continued for a minimum of 8 cycles and could be extended until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or death.	Intervention	2

Cohorts 1 and 2: Percentage of Participants With a Confirmed Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0 During Dual-Agent Treatment	Results	1
Tumor response was assessed using RECIST version 1.0 to determine the objective response (OR) rate, or the percentage of participants with either confirmed CR or PR. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and PR was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter compared to Baseline. Response was to be confirmed a minimum of 4 weeks after the initial response was documented. The OR rate was calculated as [number of participants meeting the above criteria divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.	Results	2
