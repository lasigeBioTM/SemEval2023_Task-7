a. Definition of positive: > 4 MM/ml b. Timing of bone marrow aspiration to determine study eligibility: i. If patient is to receive either no adjuvant therapy or hormonal therapy alone, the aspiration may be performed at diagnosis as part of the large MM study at University of California, San Francisco, or following diagnosis if the patient received initial surgery elsewhere. This is also true for patients who have surgery following neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer.	Eligibility	4
