cancer	DOID:162	71-77
FACT-B is used for assessment of health-related quality of life (QoL) in participants with breast cancer. It consists of 36 items, summarized to 5 subscales: physical (7 items), functional (7 items), social/family (7 items); all 3 ranged from 0 to 28, emotional (6 items) ranging from 0 to 24, and breast cancer subscale (9 items) ranging from 0 to 36; high subscale score represents a better QoL. All single-item measures range from 0='Not at all' to 4='Very much'. Total possible score ranged from 0 to 144. High scale score represents a better QoL.	Results	2
