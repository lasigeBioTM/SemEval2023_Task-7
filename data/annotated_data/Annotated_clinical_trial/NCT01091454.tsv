3-month Progression-free Survival (3-mo PFS) Rate	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	45-49
A patient is considered to be a 3-month progression-free survivor if the patient is on study treatment 3 months from registration without a documentation of disease progression. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients and 95% confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner. If some patients are lost to follow-up not having been observed for at least 3 months, an estimate and confidence interval for the 3-month PFS rate incorporating censoring will be computed using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Progression is defined using the revised RECIST guideline (v1.1) as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.	Results	2
