At present, the potential of AZD2171 for clinically significant drug interactions involving the CYP isozymes is unknown; however, studies of the agent in rats indicated possible suppression of CYP1A that may be of biological significance; eligibility of patients receiving any medications or substances known to affect or with the potential to affect the activity or PK of AZD2171 will be determined following review of their case by the Principal Investigator.	Eligibility	18

AZD2171 has been shown to terminate fetal development in the rat, as expected for a process dependent on VEGF signaling; for this reason, women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry; women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately	Eligibility	19
