Progression-Free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of objectively determined progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause, whichever is first. Disease progression is defined as 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study (included baseline sum if that was the smallest on study); sum must have demonstrated an absolute increase of 5 millimeter (mm) and the appearance of 1 new lesions was progression. Participants who did not progress, were lost to follow-up, or had missed 2 or more scheduled tumor assessments were censored at the day of their last adequate tumor assessment.	Results	2
