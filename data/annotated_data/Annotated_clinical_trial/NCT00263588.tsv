The primary indicator of drug efficacy was CNS objective response rate. A CNS objective response was defined as either a Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR), as assessed by volumetric analysis of brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), provided there was no progression of systemic disease outside of the CNS, increasing steroid requirements, or worsening of Neurological signs and symptoms (NSS)	Results	4
