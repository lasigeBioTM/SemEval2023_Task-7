Disease-Free Survival (DFS) at Month 36 Post-Randomization: Main Study	Results	1
month	UO:0000035	31-36
DFS defined as time from randomization to earliest documentation of breast cancer relapse or death from any cause. DFS at Month 36 post-randomization was defined as probability of participants alive and disease-free at 36 months after the randomization. Participants withdrawn from the study for any reason in the absence of relapse were censored at the date they were last seen. Relapse was categorized as follows: loco-regional: ipsilateral breast or axillary nodal relapse; distant: distant relapse, including supraclavicular nodes; second primary breast cancer: contralateral breast cancer, excluding ductal carcinoma in situ.
