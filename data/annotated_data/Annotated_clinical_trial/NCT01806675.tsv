Change From Baseline in Maximum Standard Uptake Values (SUVmax)	Results	1
uptake	GO:0098739,BAO:0001256	41-47
Maximum standard uptake values (SUVmax) were assessed on the basis of position emission tomography (PET) scans using radiotracers 18F-FPPRGD2 and 18F-FDG at baseline and at regular medical care follow-up (6 to 12 weeks after initiation of treatment). The outcome is assessed as the difference in the maximum standard uptake values (SUVmax) values from baseline to follow-up for the 2 radiotracers, and will be reported for each disease type as the median with standard deviation.
