1. Progression-free Survival (PFS) According to Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) Based on Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)	Results	1
central	HP:0030645	136-143
PFS was defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease, or death, whichever occurs first. Response was assessed according to RECIST 1.1 by BICR. According to RECIST 1.1, progressive disease (PD) was defined as a 20% relative increase in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the nadir SOD and an absolute increase of >5 mm in the SOD, or the appearance of new lesions. PFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and median PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) in weeks was reported for each treatment arm. Per protocol, participants remained on assigned treatment until disease progression. Participants who discontinued study treatment for reasons other than disease progression continued to be assessed by imaging until objective documentation of progression. All participants (including participants who discontinued study treatment) were followed for survival until investigator notification to discontinue.	Results	2
