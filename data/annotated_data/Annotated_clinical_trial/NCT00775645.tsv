Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
12-week FACT-Taxane Neurotoxicity Model-adjusted Score in ALC and Placebo Groups	Results	1
Compare whether treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride vs placebo prevents symptoms of neuropathy as measured by the 11-item neurotoxicity (NTX) component of the Functional Assesment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Taxane Questionnaire at 12 weeks after study registration in women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy. Linear regression model adjusted for baseline score, taxane regiment, and age. Lower scores indicate worse CIPN. Total possible range is 0 to 64.
