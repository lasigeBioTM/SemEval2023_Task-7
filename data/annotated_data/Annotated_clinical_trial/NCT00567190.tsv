Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel	Intervention	1
Participants randomized to this arm received pertuzumab 420 milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks (q3w) and trastuzumab 6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) IV q3w, plus docetaxel 75 milligrams per square metre of body surface (mg/m^2) IV q3w (for at least 6 cycles; 1 cycle was 21 days). After Cycle 6, continuation of docetaxel treatment was at the discretion of the participant and treating physician. Participants remained in the treatment phase of the study until investigator-assessed radiographic or clinical evidence of disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, or study termination and were followed for survival until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or study termination.

Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Determined by an Independent Review Facility	Results	1
PFS was defined as the time from randomization to first documented radiographical progressive disease (PD), as determined by an independent review facility (IRF) using RECIST version 1.0, or death from any cause (within 18 weeks of last tumor assessment), whichever occurred first (Kaplan-Meier method). For target lesions, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the LD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 new lesion. For non-target lesions, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 new lesion or unequivocal progression of existing lesions. Participants without IRF-determined PD or who had not died within 18 weeks of their last IRF-determined, progression-free tumor assessment were censored at the date of the last IRF-reviewed, evaluable tumor assessment; those with no post-baseline tumor assessment and who had not died within 18 weeks of baseline were censored at 1 day.

Arm/Group Title: Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel	Results	5
Arm/Group Description: Participants randomized to this arm received pertuzumab 420 milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks (q3w) and trastuzumab 6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) IV q3w, plus docetaxel 75 milligrams per square metre of body surface (mg/m^2) IV q3w (for at least 6 cycles; 1 cycle was 21 days). After Cycle 6, continuation of docetaxel treatment was at the discretion of the participant and treating physician. Participants remained in the treatment phase of the study until investigator-assessed radiographic or clinical evidence of disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, or study termination and were followed for survival until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or study termination.
