Patient Comfort Scale	Results	1
patient	HADO:0000008,OAE:0001817	0-7
Patient comfort was measured with a comfort scale between 1-10 measuring incisional pain, pain caused by the drains, discomfort or sleep disturbances caused by the drains. 1 denotes no discomfort related to drains, 10 denotes maximum discomfort unrelieved even with nonsteroid antiinflammatory analgesics. The data will be presented by median value and range (minimum-maximum).	Results	2
