Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants Showing an Overall Response As Assessed by the Independent Radiology Reader and by the Investigator	Results	1
Percentage of participants who achieve an objective confirmed complete or partial overall response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. A complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all known disease and no new sites or disease related symptoms. A partial response (PR) is >= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesion. PR was also recorded when all measurable disease has completely disappeared, but a non-measurable component (ie, ascites) is still present but not progressing. Overall response (ORR) = CR+PR.
