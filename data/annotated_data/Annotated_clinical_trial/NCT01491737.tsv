Arm A: Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab + AI +/- Chemotherapy	Intervention	1
Participants received pertuzumab at a loading dose of 840 mg followed by 420 mg along with trastuzumab at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg of body weight followed by 6 mg/kg of body weight on Day 1 or Day 2 of each 3-weekly cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death, or the predefined end of study whichever occurred first. Participants also received an aromatase inhibitor (AI), orally as per product labeling (anastrozole: 1 mg once daily or letrozole: 2.5 mg once daily). Participants receiving induction chemotherapy up to the first 18-24 weeks of the treatment period were to receive a taxane (docetaxel every 3 weeks or paclitaxel weekly), administered in line with the respective product labeling.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization until the first radiographically documented progression of disease or death from any cause, whichever occurred first (either during study treatment or during follow-up). Progression of disease was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1 and is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). The sum of target lesion diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). Participants with no PFS events were censored at the time of the last evaluable tumor assessment. The primary analysis of PFS was planned to be performed when a total of 165 PFS events had occurred, and the final analysis after at least 60 months follow-up.	Results	2
