Low Dose	Intervention	1
Low dose of the psychoeducational intervention (i.e., 8.0 hours with the intervention nurse over 10 weeks)	Intervention	2
PRO-SELF PLUS Pain Management Program: The psychoeducational intervention will be conducted by specially trained oncology nurses and will include the components of knowledge, skills training, and coaching to improve cancer pain management. Patients in both groups will be seen in their homes over the course of 10 weeks with phone calls conducted in between the home visits. Patients in the HIGH-DOSE group will receive 6 visits and 10 phone calls [total time 12.3 hours]. Patients in the LOW-DOSE group will receive 4 visits and 6 phone calls [8.0 hours]. Follow-up visits to assess the sustainability of the intervention will be done at 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after the intervention. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses will be conducted to evaluate patient outcomes.	Intervention	3
