FdCyd (100 mg/m(2)) + THU (350 mg/m(2)) administered 5 days/week for 2 weeks in 28-day cycles	Intervention	2
5-Fluoro-2'-Deoxycytidine (FdCyd) + Tetrahydrouridine (THU): FdCyd, a fluoropyrimidine nucleoside analog, has a short (10-minute) half-life and is rapidly degraded in vivo by cytidine deaminase. However, co-administration with THU, an inhibitor of cytidine/deoxycytidine deaminase, has been shown to increase the area under the curve (AUC) of the parent compound more than 4-fold. Increased FdCyd exposure allows it to be taken up intracellularly and converted to its triphosphate, which is incorporated into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and inhibits the action of the enzyme DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). Inhibition of daunomycin DNMT, and in turn DNA methylation, can result in the re-expression of tumor suppressor genes.	Intervention	3

Progression-free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time interval from start of treatment to documented evidence of disease progression. Disease progression was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.
