Pregnant women will not be excluded from this study because the study intervention(s) pose no risk of potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. In fact, gentle yoga practice is quite safe for pregnant women and poses can be slightly modified, if needed. The anticipated number of pregnant women eligible to enroll is minimal.	Eligibility	14
