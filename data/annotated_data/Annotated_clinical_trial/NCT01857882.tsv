Decision Self-efficacy Scale	Results	1
Decision self-efficacy (DSE) scale is a prospectively designed instrument to evaluate patient self-confidence in decision-making, including shared decision-making. It has been validated among women facing treatment decisions for osteoporosis and used in cancer patients. Psychometric evaluation has shown high levels of internal consistency (Cronbach alpha 0.90). Decision self-efficacy is correlated with decision conflict subscales of feeling informed (r = 0.47) and supported (r = 0.45). This instrument has never been tested in the breast cancer or breast reconstruction population.	Results	2

The total score is calculated by summing the 11 items, dividing by 11 and multiplying by 25. Scores range from 0 (extremely low self-efficacy) to 100 (extremely high self-efficacy).	Results	3
range	LABO:0000114	100-105
The mean and standard deviation (SD) were calculated at baseline and after the initial consultation. Change in score was defined as the difference in total score between baseline and after consultation.	Results	4
