Participants were treated with intravenous (IV) doxorubicin (60 milligrams per meters squared [mg/m^2]) and cyclophosphamide (AC) (600 mg/m^2) every 21 days for 4 cycles. This was followed by weekly paclitaxel (WP) 80 mg/m^2 IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days for 4 cycles given concurrently with oral pazopanib 800 mg (2 tablets taken at the same time each day, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) taken daily and continuing until 7 days before surgery.
