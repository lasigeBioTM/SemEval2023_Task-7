ABI-007 Plus Bevacizumab	Intervention	1
ABI-007 is administered on days 1, 8 and 15 at 125 mg/m^2 and bevacizumab is administered on day 1 and 15 at 10 mg/kg of each 28 day cycle. Treatment continues until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. If a patient develops intolerable toxicity to only one of the drugs, the other drug may be continued as single agent therapy in the absence of progression, as long as the treating physician feels this is in the best interests of the patient.
