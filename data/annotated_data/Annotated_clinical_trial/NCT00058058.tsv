INTERVENTION 1:	Intervention	0
Reference Standard Positive (RS+)	Intervention	1
Reference Standard Positive indicates a breast cancer diagnosed in the contralateral (study) breast. Participants who received a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ or any invasive breast cancer as a result of a biopsy or surgery that was performed within 365 days of the initial MRI scan were considered positive for cancer. Participants were considered positive only on the basis of positive tissue diagnosis.	Intervention	2
