chest	UBERON:0001443	111-116
excluded	HP:0040285	147-155
Patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy are excluded because of an increased relative risk of skin toxicity; patients taking daily proton-pump inhibitor or H2-blocker antacid medications are excluded because of predicted interference of alkaline water consumption and stomach pH; herceptin for the purposes of this clinical trial would be considered a chemotherapy, and as such, patients receiving herceptin chemotherapy during radiation would not be eligible for participation in this protocol	Eligibility	7

Information will include the type, severity, time of onset and resolution of its onset, and its probable association with the study regimen. Frequency tables will be constructed to summarize observed incidents by severity and type of toxicity during weekly radiation treatment and 1 month after radiation treatment. Observed toxicity differences among the treatment arms may be reported in frequency tables.	Results	2
