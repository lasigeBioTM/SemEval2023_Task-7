Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Number of Participants With a 50% Decrease in Hot Flash Score	Results	1
50% decrease in hot flash score. The hot flash score is calculated as the weighted sum of the number of hot flashes in each severity category multiplied by a severity-exclusive weight (1-mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe, 4-very severe). The minimum is 0 and there is no maximum. For example a woman can experience an unlimited number of hot flashes per day. Higher score indicates worse outcome.	Results	2
