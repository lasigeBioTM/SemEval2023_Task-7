Rate of pCR (as defined by NSABP criteria - absence of invasive disease in the breast [ypT0]) is the number of of participants with pathological complete response (pCR) at the time of surgery. Participants were to be considered in pCR if there was no invasive cancer in the breast or only non-invasive in situ cancer in the breast specimen. NSABP guidelines do not take into account the histological nodal status to define the pCR.	Results	2
