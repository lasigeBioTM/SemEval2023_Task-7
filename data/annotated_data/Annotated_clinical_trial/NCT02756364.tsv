Progression Free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.
