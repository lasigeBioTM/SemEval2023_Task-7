Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression-free Survival (PFS) and to Evaluate Safety of the Trastuzumab, Bevacizumab and Docetaxel Regimen.	Results	1
The trial was designed as a single-stage phase II rather then usual two-stage design because of the progression free survival (PFS) primary endpoint, as it is impractical to wait to assess PFS for patients in the first stage. We will consider a PFS of 50% at twelve months (median PFS of 12 months) or less uninteresting and a PFS of 70% at twelve months (median PFS of twenty months) worthy of pursuing the regimen in a future trials. The single-stage design is as follows: p0=0.50, p1=0.70, α=0.10, β= 0.10. This leads to a total sample size of 39 patients, 24 or higher of who are progression-free at 12 months.	Results	2
