RECIST-based response assessment was done at Weeks (Wks) 4 and 8 and every 8 weeks thereafter. Cutaneous disease assessment was done at Wk 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter. OR was evaluated when the skin and RECIST assessments coincided. Per RECIST, CR is the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum LD. Cutaneous disease contained non-measurable and measurable skin disease, which was assessed by skin assessment tools.	Results	2
