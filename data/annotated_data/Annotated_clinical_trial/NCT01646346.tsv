Patients with a history of non-ipsilateral breast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for 2 or more years prior to enrollment. Patients with the following cancers are eligible even if diagnosed and treated within the past 2 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
