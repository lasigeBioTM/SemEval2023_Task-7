Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a specialized technique associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRS is a non-invasive way to obtain biochemical information about the tissues of the human body. Participants underwent single voxel (3-dimensional volume X pixel) MRS to measure CNS glutamate before and after 1 and 8 weeks of riluzole or placebo treatment. Voxels were placed in the right and left basal ganglia and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), well known targets of inflammatory cytokines on the brain, and cytokine effects on these brain regions have been associated with symptoms of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction as well as reduced motivation. MRS has shown that chronic exposure to the inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-alpha leads to increased CNS glutamate (as reflected by the glutamate/creatine (Glu/Cr) ratio) which correlated with symptoms of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction.
