Inclusion Criteria:	Eligibility	0
Subgroup 1, Patients with breast lesions:	Eligibility	1
breast	UBERON:0000310	26-32
-At least one breast lesion detected by mammogram, ultrasound or breast MRI that measures < 20 mm in greatest dimension, presents as a mass, is considered suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System Atlas criteria (BIRADS 4 or 5), and is scheduled for core-needle biopsy or surgical biopsy.	Eligibility	2
breast	UBERON:0000310	14-20
breast	UBERON:0000310	65-71
breast	UBERON:0000310	218-224
OR	Eligibility	3
-At least one breast lesion that measures between > 10 mm but < 20 mm in greatest dimension, presents as a mass, is biopsy-proven as malignant, and is scheduled for surgical resection.	Eligibility	4

AND	Eligibility	5
Age > 40 years	Eligibility	6
age	PATO:0000011	0-3
Negative pregnancy test, postmenopausal, or surgically sterilized	Eligibility	7
Subgroup 2, Patients without known breast lesions:	Eligibility	8
breast	UBERON:0000310	35-41
Negative screening mammogram performed at Mayo Clinic Rochester within 15 months prior to performance of study MBI	Eligibility	9
No signs or symptoms of breast disease	Eligibility	10
breast disease	DOID:3463	24-38
Age > 40 years	Eligibility	11
age	PATO:0000011	0-3
Negative pregnancy test, postmenopausal, or surgically sterilized	Eligibility	12
Exclusion Criteria:	Eligibility	13
Vacuum-assisted or excisional biopsy has been performed prior to the study MBI. Reason: these types of biopsies are more likely to remove all of the tumor	Eligibility	14
MBI is performed after biopsy and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is planned prior to surgery. Reason: true tumor size will not be able to be ascertained from the final pathology findings	Eligibility	15
surgery	OAE:0000067	80-87
size	PATO:0000117	108-112
Breast implants. Reason: cases with breast implants will be easily identifiable on blinded interpretation to take place at the study end	Eligibility	16
breast	UBERON:0000310	0-6
breast	UBERON:0000310	36-42
Suspected that breasts will not fit in the MBI field of view. Reason: cases that require tiled views or additional views will be easily identifiable on blinded interpretation to take place at the study end	Eligibility	17
Only one breast remaining. Reason: unilateral cases will be easily identifiable on blinded interpretation to take place at the study end; injection timing is designed for bilateral views	Eligibility	18
breast	UBERON:0000310	9-15
unilateral	HP:0012833	35-45
bilateral	HP:0012832	171-180
Pregnancy test (if necessary) is not negative, or the patient is unable to complete the pregnancy test	Eligibility	19
patient	HADO:0000008,OAE:0001817	54-61
Physically unable to sit upright and still remain still during two consecutive MBI studies over the course of a 2-hour period.	Eligibility	20
