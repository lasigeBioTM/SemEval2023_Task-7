Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
To Evaluate the Efficacy of Flaxseed on Hot Flash Scores in Women as Measured by a Daily Prospective Hot Flash Diary.	Results	1
efficacy	BAO:0000656	16-24
The intra-patient difference in hot flash activity between baseline (study week 1) and treatment termination (study week 7) is the primary endpoint. The hot flash activity will be measured by the weekly average hot flash score which is a composite entity of both frequency and severity of hot flashes.	Results	2
week	UO:0000034	75-79
week	UO:0000034	116-120

frequency	HP:0040279	263-272
severity	HP:0012824	277-285
hot flashes	HP:0031217	289-300
The hot flash severities are graded from 1 to 4, ranging from mild, to moderate, to severe to very severe. The daily hot flash score is computed by multiplying the mean grade of severity by the frequency during every 24 hour period. Therefore, a score of zero is the lowest possible score and can be interpreted as having no hot flashes. The average daily hot flash score during the baseline week was compared to the average daily value during week 7.	Results	3
