CNS Objective Response Rate (ORR)	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	23-27
The central nervous system (CNS) ORR was defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria in the evaluation CNS lesions on treatment: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.	Results	2
