Invasive Disease-Free Survival (IDFS) in the Node-Positive Subpopulation	Results	1
IDFS event was defined as the time from randomization until the date of first occurrence of one of the following: Ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence (an invasive breast cancer [bc] involving the same breast parenchyma as the original primary lesion); Ipsilateral local-regional invasive bc recurrence (an invasive bc in the axilla, regional lymph nodes, chest wall, and/or skin of the ipsilateral breast); Contralateral or ipsilateral second primary invasive bc; Distant recurrence (evidence of bc in any anatomic site [other than the three sites mentioned above]) that has either been histologically confirmed or clinically/radiographically diagnosed as recurrent invasive bc; Death attributable to any cause, including bc, non-bc, or unknown cause. 3-year IDFS event-free rate per randomized treatment arms in the ITT population was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and estimated the probability of a participant being event-free after 3 years after randomization.
