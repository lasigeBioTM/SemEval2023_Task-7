Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR) Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version (RECIST) 1.1	Results	1
Objective response according to RECIST v1.1. Best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) recorded since first administration of trial medication and until the earliest of disease progression, death or start of next treatment in each part separately. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), >=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Objective Response (OR) = CR + PR. Percentage of participants with OR along with exact 95% Confidence Interval by Clopper and Pearson is presented.	Results	2
