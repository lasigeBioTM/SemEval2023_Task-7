INTERVENTION 1:	Intervention	0
ISB and IC-Green Dye	Intervention	1
dye	CHEBI:37958	17-20
The dose of Isosulfan blue (ISB) dye is 3 to 5 mL and Indocyanine green solution will be started at 1 mg/mL. If fluorescence is not detected with this dose, then it will be increased by 50%. A gamma probe [Neoprobe 2010] will be used to localize the sentinel lymph nodes in the axilla.	Intervention	2
