Average Area Under the Curve per assessment (aAUCpa) of EORTC Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Module (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20) Sensory Neuropathy Subscale adjusting for baseline. The EORTC CIPN20 scoring algorithm was used for the sensory (items 31-36, 39, 40 and 48) subscale scores on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores represent fewer symptoms (better QOL). The aAUCpa for the subscale is calculated as the average of each AUC between each sequential assessment from pre-treatment-initiation to the week-12 assessment then subtract the corresponding baseline Sensory Neuropathy subscale score, with positive scores represent symptoms has improved from baseline and negative scores represent symptoms has worsen from baseline.
