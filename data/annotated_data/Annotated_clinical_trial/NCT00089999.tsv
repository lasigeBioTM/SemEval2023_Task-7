Number of Participants With a Best Overall Response (OR) of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)	Results	1
OR is defined as the number of participants achieving either a confirmed CR or PR, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, v 1.0). Best OR is defined as the best response recorded from the start of treatment until progressive disease (PD)/recurrence. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) and non-TLs. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of TLs, taking as a reference the Baseline sum LD and no PD, or complete resolution of TLs and the persistence of one or more non-TL(s), as assessed by the IRC. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of TLs, taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of >= 1 new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Responses were confirmed at subsequent assessments made >=28 days after the original response. Participants with an unknown or missing response are treated as non-responders.	Results	2
