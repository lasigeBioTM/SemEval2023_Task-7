Endoxifen Concentrations in Participants Receiving Tamoxifen Citrate Dose of 20 mg or 40 mg Stratified by the Metabolizing CYP2D6 Genotypes	Results	1
tamoxifen citrate	CHEBI:9397	51-68
Measurements of plasma concentrations of the key active metabolite of tamoxifen, endoxifen, were measured at baseline and after 4 months of treatment; The most common CYP2D6 alleles have been grouped by functional activity classifications with descending activity: ultra-rapid (UM), extensive (EM), intermediate (IM) or poor (PM) metabolism. A given patient has two alleles, giving them 10 possible allelic combinations, or diplotypes (UM/UM, UM/EM, EM/EM, etc.). These diplotypes are collapsed into four phenotypes, UM, EM, IM or PM.
