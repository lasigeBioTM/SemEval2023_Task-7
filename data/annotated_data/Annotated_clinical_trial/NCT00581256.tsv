IMRT: All patients treated with the optimized plan will be treated to the entire target volume to 52.2 Gy in 1.74 Gy fractions, which is biologically equivalent to 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. This fractionation scheme will allow the boost of 10 Gy to be incorporated into the planning directive and to be delivered simultaneously with the treatment to the remaining target volume.

The Number of Participants With a Significant Increase in Perfusion Defects (PD)	Results	1
increase	BAO:0001251	46-54
To compare the extent of new myocardial perfusion defects following breast cancer radiotherapy using the best standard 3-D radiotherapy technique, partially wide tangent fields, versus the best optimized technique. Perfusion defects (PD) were assessed by comparing normalized perfusion distributions against our institution's normal polar map databases for the left anterior descending artery (LAD) using thresholds of 2.5-SD (standard deviation) and 1.5-SD below the normal mean. On the basis of interest variability, a PD increase greater than 5% or 10% was considered significant for 2.5- and 1.5-SD thresholds, respectively.	Results	2
