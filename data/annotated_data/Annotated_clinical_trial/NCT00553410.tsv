Duration of time from randomization to the first indication of the following events: invasive recurrence at local (including recurrence restricted to the breast after breast conserving treatment), regional or distant sites; a new invasive cancer in the contralateral breast; any second (non-breast) invasive malignancy; or a death without prior cancer event.
