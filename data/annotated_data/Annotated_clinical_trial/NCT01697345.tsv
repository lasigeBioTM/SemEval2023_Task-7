The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire was administered to participants prior to starting vaginal testosterone therapy and the survey was repeated after using the study drug for 4 weeks. The participants served as their own controls. The FSFI assesses six domains of sexual functioning (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain) over the past 4 weeks. The sum of all domain scores equals the total FSFI score. The total FSFI score ranges from 2-36 and a total FSFI score < 26.5 suggests female sexual dysfunction.	Results	2
