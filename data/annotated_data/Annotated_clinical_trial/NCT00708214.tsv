Percentage of Progression Free Participants After 16 Weeks of Treatment	Results	1
Progression was defined according to 1 of the following criteria: New bone lesion(s) on bone scan or on magnetic resonance imaging; Progression or occurrence of new lesion(s) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours version 1.0 (RECIST); an increase in tumour marker CA 15.3 of more than 20 percent,compared with baseline, at 2 consecutive examinations; occurrence of disease-related skeletal events. If a patient did not fulfil any criteria and was withdrawn because of clinical deterioration amounting to PD according to the Investigator, they were considered as having PD.	Results	2
