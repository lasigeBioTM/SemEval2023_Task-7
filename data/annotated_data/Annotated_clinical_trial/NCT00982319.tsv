Pathologists score the slides without knowledge of treatment assignment at the end of the study. All pre-post samples from one individual will be evaluated together. Quality control for these stains is performed routinely in the immunohistochemistry lab (using lymphoid tissue for Ki67). Initial scoring is performed where possible on a minimum of 3000 cells, by counting the number of positive cells divided by the total number of cells. DCIS lesions will be scored separately to adjacent normal tissue. The rationale for selecting Ki67 as a measure of cellular proliferation includes the robustness of the staining reaction, correlation with the S phase fraction of the cell cycle and mitotic index and that it can be successfully ascertained from core breast biopsies provided there is an adequate yield of epithelial cells. A negative value reflects a decrease in ki67 positive cells, therefore a decrease in cellular proliferation.	Results	2
