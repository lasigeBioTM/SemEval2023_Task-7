To Determine Whether the Prophylactic Use of a Topical Urea/Lactic Acid Cream Can Decrease the Incidence/Severity of Capecitabine-caused Palmar-plantar Erythrodysesthesia	Results	1
acid	CHEBI:37527	67-71
A patient self-reported hand-foot syndrome (HFSD), also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, was completed daily while applying the cream. Patients rated skin severity symptoms individually in their hands and in their feet. Definitions of symptoms, which were based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0, were provided to patients. The number of patients reporting moderate to severe symptoms in either hands or feet were tabulated and percentages are reported.	Results	2
