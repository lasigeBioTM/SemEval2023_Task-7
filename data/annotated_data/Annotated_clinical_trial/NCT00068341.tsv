rate	BAO:0080019	32-36
Objective response rate of patients treated with Taxotere/carboplatin with or without Herceptin preoperatively. Objective response equals the combination of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and marginal response (MR).	Results	2

Tumor size was assessed by (1) physical examination, (2) mammography and (3) MRI. 5 response groups: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), marginal response (MR), stable disease (SD) & disease progression (DP). Pathologic response assigned into 2 groups: pCR and non-pCR. pCR-no evidence of residual invasive disease in specimen.	Results	3
