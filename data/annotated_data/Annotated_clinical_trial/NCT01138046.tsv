Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Number of Participants With Intolerable Toxicities in Phase I of the Study	Results	1
Investigational treatment was considered tolerable if one or more of the tolerability criteria were met by none or one of the 6 participants in the first cycle of Phase I. If one or more tolerability criteria were met by two or more participants, the issue was referred to the safety committee. Tolerability criteria for toxicities related to investigational treatment included grade 4 neutropenia persisting for 7 or more days, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of less than or equal to 25,000/millimeter (mm)^3 , clinically significant Grade 3 or 4 non-haematologic toxicities (excluding nausea) and inability to start cycle 2 within 2 weeks of scheduled dosing due to unresolved toxicity.
