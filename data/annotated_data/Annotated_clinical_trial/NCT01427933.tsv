Progression-Free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
PFS was defined as time from date of randomization until the date of objectively determined progression defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) criteria or death from any cause, whichever is first. Progressive disease (PD) defined as 20% increase in sum of diameter (SOD) of target lesion with the sum demonstrating an increase of 5 mm; appearance of 1 new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Participants with no baseline disease assessment were censored at randomization date, regardless of whether or not objectively determined PD or death was observed; participants not known to have died or to have objective progression as of data inclusion cutoff date were censored at last post baseline radiological assessment date or randomization date, if there was no post baseline radiological assessment.
