Progression Free Survival Using the RECIST 1.1 Criteria	Results	1
progression free survival (PFS) is defined as time from randomization to progression or death from any cause. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.
