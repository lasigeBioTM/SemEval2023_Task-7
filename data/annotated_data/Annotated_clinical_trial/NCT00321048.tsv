Efficacy of the ABC device in protecting the heart from radiation (XRT) damage in patients with L breast cancer is determined by the change in cardiac perfusion (mean apical perfusion score) as measured by SPECT between baseline and 6 month follow up. A score of 1 represents an equivocal or mild reduction in perfusion, 2 represents moderately reduced perfusion, 3 represents severely reduced perfusion, and 4 indicates absent perfusion.	Results	2
