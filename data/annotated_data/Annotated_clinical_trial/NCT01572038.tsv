Overview of the Number of Participants With at Least One Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event, Severity Determined According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v4.0)	Results	1

severity	HP:0012824	91-99
cancer	DOID:162	133-139
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were adverse events (AEs) that started or worsened in severity on or after the first administration of study drug, up to and including 28 days after the last dose. The investigator graded all AEs for severity per NCI-CTCAE v4.0; if not listed, the AE was assessed as follows: Grade 1 = mild; Grade 2 = moderate; Grade 3 = severe; Grade 4 = life-threatening/disabling; Grade 5 = death. The investigator determined whether an AE was related to study drug and independently assessed severity and seriousness of each AE. TEAEs to monitor included anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity, cardiac dysfunction, diarrhoea Grade 3, pregnancy-related AEs, interstitial lung disease, infusion-/administration-related reactions, mucositis, (febrile) neutropenia, rash/skin reactions, and suspected transmission of infectious agent. TEAEs of special interest included LVEF decreased, liver enzymes increased, and suspected transmission of infectious agent by the study drug.	Results	2
