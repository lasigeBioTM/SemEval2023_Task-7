The Short Form of the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory (MFSI-sf) was used to measure fatigue. The range of possible score for each subscale is 0 to 24, and the range for total score is -24 to 96, with a higher score indicating more severe fatigue, except for the Vigor subscale, where larger score indicates less fatigue.
