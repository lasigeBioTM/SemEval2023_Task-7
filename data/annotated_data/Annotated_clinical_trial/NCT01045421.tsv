Toxicity according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.0. DLT defined as any of the following considered related to alisertib by investigator: Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/cubic meter [cells/mm^3]) for >7 days; Grade 4 neutropenia with coincident fever; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25,000 cells/mm3) for >7 days; Platelet count <10,000 cells/mm3; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding; Delay in initiation of the subsequent therapy cycle by >7 days due to treatment-related toxicity; >=Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity except >=Grade 3 nausea/emesis occurred in the absence of optimal antiemetic therapy; >=Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in the absence of optimal supportive therapy with loperamide/comparable antidiarrheal; Grade 3 fatigue for <1 week; Other Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity that could be safely, reliably controlled to <=Grade 2 with appropriate treatment.
