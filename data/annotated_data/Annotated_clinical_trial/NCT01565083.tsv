Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response (BOR) as Assessed by Investigator According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)	Results	1
Tumor response was assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1. BOR was defined as percentage of participants with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total or pathological nodes (with short axis [SA] of at least (>/=) 15 millimeter [mm]) were identified as target lesions (TLs) and measured and recorded at baseline. A sum of diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, SA for nodal lesions) for all TLs was calculated and reported as baseline sum of diameters (SD). All other lesions (or sites of disease) were identified as non-TLs. CR: disappearance of all TLs and SA reduction to less than (<) 10 mm for nodal TLs/ non-TLs. PR: >/=30 percent (%) decrease in SD of TLs, taking as reference baseline SD. Confirmation of response at 2 consecutive tumor assessments >/=4 weeks apart was required. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed using Clopper-Pearson approach.	Results	2
