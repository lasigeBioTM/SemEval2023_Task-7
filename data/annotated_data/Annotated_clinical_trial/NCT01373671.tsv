The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of DBT and FFDM images together in comparison to FFDM images alone with respect to the ability of readers to detect and diagnose malignant lesions. A comparison of the breast-level ROC areas was used to evaluate the superiority of DBT as an adjunct to FFDM vs. FFDM alone.	Results	2
