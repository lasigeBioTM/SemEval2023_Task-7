Participants received sacituzumab govitecan 10 mg/kg of body weight, administered as a slow IV infusion either by gravity or with an infusion pump on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day treatment cycle for up to 29.6 months. Infusion rate for the first 15 minutes started with 50 mg/hour or less with a subsequent infusion of 100 to 200 mg/hour up to a maximum recommended rate (advanced every 15 to 30 minutes) of 500 mg/hour with a subsequent infusion of 1000 mg/hour.

PFS was defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death, whichever came first. The date of progression was date of the last observation or radiological assessment of target lesions that either showed a predefined increase (greater than or equal to [  ] 20%) in the sum of the target lesions or the appearance of new non-target lesions. PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimate.	Results	2
