surgery	OAE:0000067	33-40
A "close" surgical margin implies that cancer cells are found on pathology to be very close to the surgical margin, and a "wide" surgical margin implies the tumor exists far from the cut edge or the surgical margin. For this study, we defined "close" as less than 3 mm.	Results	2
