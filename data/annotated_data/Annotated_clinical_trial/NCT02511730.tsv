Breast AUC performance metrics to determine if FFDM plus DBT improved cancer detection rate, requiring correct lesion localization. Statistician to estimate AUCs for each reader in each review condition (FFDM read in conjunction with FFDM plus DBT read) based on their Probability of Malignancy (POM) scores. POM scores will require correct lesion localization, such that in a case with cancer if the reader recorded one or more findings in the case but none of them are determined by the truther to match the location(s) of any proven malignancies, a POM score of 0 will be assigned to the case. Statistician to provide graphical representations of each reader's ROC curve for each review condition. For each reader the difference between the AUC for the FFDM read in conjunction with the FFDM plus DBT will be presented. Statistician to perform MRMC comparison of AUC's between FFDM read in conjunction with FFDM plus DBT using the MRMC method of Dorfman, Berbaum & Metz (1992).	Results	2
