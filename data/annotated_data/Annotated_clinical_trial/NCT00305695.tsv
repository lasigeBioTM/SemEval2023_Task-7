Bone Mineral Density of the Lumbar Spine as Measured by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) Scan at 9 Months	Results	1
bone mineral density	CMO:0001226	0-20
To compare the effect of zoledronic acid administered every 6 months on bone loss associated with surgery (at a minimum, any surgical procedure that results in removal of both ovaries), as compared with observation alone. This is to be evaluated by measuring the change from baseline to 9 months in bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine, specifically L1-L4 dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).	Results	2
