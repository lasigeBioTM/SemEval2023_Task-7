The effects of ABT-888 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because cyclophosphamide hydrochloride is known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (abstinence; female use of hormonal methods, or barrier methods of birth control; male use of a condom) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after completion of study. Because there is a risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cyclophosphamide, breastfeeding should be discontinued while the patient is on this trial and for 30 days after completion of treatment on this trial. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.	Eligibility	27

Complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) of the combination of ABT-888 with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide to the response rate (CR+PR) of metronomic oral cyclophosphamide in patients with deleterious BRCA mutations and refractory ovarian cancer or patients with primary peritoneal or ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma or fallopian tube cancer. CR + PR was determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm). Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.	Results	2
