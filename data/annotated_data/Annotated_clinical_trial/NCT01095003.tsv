Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression Free Survival	Results	1
PFS is defined as time from date of randomization to date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression (according to the Independent Response Review Committee (IRC) and based on RECIST version 1.1) or death due to any cause.	Results	2
time	PATO:0000165	18-22
death	OAE:0000632	214-219
The PFS was primarily analysed in the Intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Patients lost to follow-up, or without a known record of progression or death at time of analysis had the progression-free survival censored at the date of last tumour assessment or the date of last contact of a follow-up showing no progression, whichever occurs last.
