Paced Respiration	Intervention	1
The paced respiration intervention group received a compact disc with paper booklet. The booklet reinforced instructions on the first audio track for how to accomplish a target breath rate of 6-8 breaths per minute, practice twice per day for 15 minutes, and apply the breathing at the onset of each hot flash. Women were instructed to do slow, deep, abdominal breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth as per international recommendations. They were also instructed to practice twice per day for 15 minutes as per the small, laboratory-based studies. The second and third tracks contained specially composed, digitally recorded music to help entrain the breath rate and structure the length of practice.	Intervention	2
