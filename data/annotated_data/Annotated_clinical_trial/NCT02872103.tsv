Subjects will be randomized to F-627 or Placebo at 2:1 ratio. About 24 hours after chemotherapy, subjects will either receive 20mg fixed dose F-627 or Placebo. The subject's absolute neutrophil count (ANC) will be monitored each day post chemotherapy administration until the ANC level exceeds 2.0x10^9/L, then the value will be monitored every three days until the next chemotherapy cycle is entered. The duration of grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5x10^9/L) in this cycle is the primary efficacy endpoint.	Results	2
