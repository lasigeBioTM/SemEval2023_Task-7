Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression Free Survival (PFS)	Results	1
PFS was assessed by the investigator based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria using radiographic tumor evaluations. Disease progression was defined as the appearance of any new lesion not previously identified or an estimated increase of 25% or more in existent bidimensionally or unidimensionally measurable lesions or progression of an existing non-measurable lesion. For bidimensionally measurable malignant lesions with an area of at least 2.0 centimeters squared (cm^2) an increase of 1.0 cm^2 was required and for unidimensionally measurable lesions of 1.0 cm or less an increase of 0.5 cm was required. PFS was defined as the number of days between date of randomization and date of documented disease progression or date of death. Kaplan Meier estimates of PFS are presented.	Results	2
