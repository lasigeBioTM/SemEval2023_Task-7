Trastuzumab/Ixabepilone/Carboplatin	Intervention	1
During the induction phase, patients were treated with Ixabepilone (BMS-247550) 15mg/m2 intravenously (IV) followed by carboplatin (AUC=2 IV) on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles. Trastuzumab was administered weekly (4mg/kg loading dose then 2mg/kg IV) starting on day 1. Routine premedication included H1 blocker (diphenhydramine 50 mg orally (PO) or IV), H2 blocker (ranitidine 150 mg PO or 50 mg IV or another equivalent H2 blocker), and at least a 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone.

To assess objective response, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline to which subsequent measurements will be compared. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each lesion at baseline and during follow-up.	Results	2
The best overall response based on RECIST is the best response recorded from registration until disease progression/recurrence, taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since registration. The best response was determined based on the tumor responses in target and nontarget lesions, with or without new lesions. To be assigned a status of complete or partial response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements must have met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 8 weeks.	Results	3
