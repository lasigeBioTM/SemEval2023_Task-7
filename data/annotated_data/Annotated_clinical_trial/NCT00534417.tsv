Time to progression is defined as the time from treatment start until objective tumor progression. Progression is defined per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)v1.0 guidelines as a measurable increase in the smallest diameter of any target lesion, progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. The median time to progression is the parameter used to describe TTP.	Results	2
