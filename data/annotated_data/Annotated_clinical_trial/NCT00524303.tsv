Percentage of Participants With Overall Pathological Complete Response (pCR) After 26 Weeks of Therapy	Results	1
A pCR in the breast was defined as no pathologic evidence of invasive disease (residual ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] or lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS] was allowed). A pCR in the axillary lymph node(s) was defined as no evidence of breast cancer cells in the lymph node (including subcapsular sinus). Overall pCR was defined as the sum of pCR in the breast and pCR in the lymph nodes. 26 weeks of therapy comprised the 2-week run-in phase, 12 weeks of treatment with FEC, and 12 weeks of treatment with Paclitaxel.
