TE-ADM With PMRT	Intervention	1
Participants received immediate breast reconstruction using a sub-muscular tissue expander (TE) and acellular dermal matrix (ADM) sling placed during the same surgery. This was followed by post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) no sooner than a minimum of 6 weeks and optimally 6 months, if adjuvant chemotherapy was required. The prescribed chest-wall dose was 50 -50.4 gray (Gy) in 25-28 fractions given once daily over 5-7 weeks with a 0.5-centimeter (cm) bolus to the scar every other day. Permanent reconstruction was performed at least 5 months after completion of PMRT.	Intervention	2

Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin	Eligibility	14

Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Success Rate	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	8-12
Success rate was defined as the percentage of participants experiencing all of the following: 1) completion of PMRT and placement of the permanent implant and/or flap reconstruction; 2) no major complications (infection requiring hospitalization, major revisions, early/severe capsular contracture, or pain requiring implant removal); and 3) a physician-reported 'excellent' or 'good' cosmetic result (not 'fair' or 'poor') at 2 years following PMRT (requiring a stable reconstruction with good symmetry and contour relative to the contralateral breast).
