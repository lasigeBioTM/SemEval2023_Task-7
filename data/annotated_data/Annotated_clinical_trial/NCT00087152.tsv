Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Confirmed Response Rate (Complete and Partial)	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	19-23
Number of participants with confirmed complete or partial response. Confirmed response (complete and partial) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria (V1.0). Complete Response (CR) is complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease; no new lesions; no disease related symptoms; and normalization of markers and other abnormal lab values. Partial response (PR) applies only to patients with at least one measurable lesion. PR is greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of longest diameter of all target measurable lesions; no unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease and no new lesions. Confirmed response is two or more objective statuses a minimum of four weeks apart documented before progression or symptomatic deterioration.	Results	2
