50 mg Dasatinib + 825 mg/m^2Capecitabine	Intervention	1
Dose Level 1: 50 milligram (mg) dasatinib oral tablet twice daily (BID) plus 825 mg per meter squared (m^2) capecitabine oral tablet BID. Participants were treated at each dose level (DL) for minimum of 21 days before accrual to the next DL. Rules for dose escalation: If 0 dose level toxicity (DLT) was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, the next higher cohort was opened to accrual. If 1 DLT was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, then 3 additional participants were studied. If 0 DLT was observed in those 3 (ie, 1 DLT in 6 subjects at the DL), the next higher cohort was opened for accrual. If >=2 DLT was observed in up to 6 subjects, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded and the next lower DL was defined as the MTD. If 0 DLT was observed in 6 participants in a cohort and the next higher DL exceeded the MTD, then intermediate DLs would be studied. Once the MTD was determined, additional participants were enrolled into that dose group.	Intervention	2

Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities Per Dose Level - Safety Population	Results	1
Safety was assessed from first dose of study drug through at least 30 days after the last dose, until resolution of drug-related toxicity or when toxicity was deemed irreversible, whichever was longer. An adverse event (AE) was considered a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) if it occurred in the first 21 days and was at least possibly related to study drugs and were: Clinically-evident toxicity of Grade >= 3, or of Grade 2 which required interruption of treatment for >= 7 days (consecutive or non-consecutive); non-hematologic abnormal laboratory value of Grade >= 3, or hematologic toxicity of Grade 4, which persisted 7 days; any grade toxicity which in the judgment of the investigator required a dose reduction or removal from further study therapy.
