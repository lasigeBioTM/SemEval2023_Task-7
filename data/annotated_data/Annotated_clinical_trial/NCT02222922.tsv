Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) - Q3W Regimen	Results	1
A DLT was any of the following adverse events(AEs) in the first cycle of treatment (within 21 days of first dose or until participant received second infusion if there were treatment delays). (1)Hematologic: including Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days; Febrile neutropenia; Grade >=3 neutropenic infection; Grade 4 anemia; Grade >=3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding. (2) Hepatic, including Grade >=3 serum bilirubin, hepatic transaminase or alkaline phosphatase; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >=3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) concurrent with elevation in bilirubin >=2.0 x ULN; (3) Grade >=3 non-hematologic, non-hepatic major organ toxicities; delayed by >2 weeks in receiving the next scheduled cycle due to persisting toxicities attributable to PF-06647020. A participant was on study for at least 21 days to be evaluable for DLT observation, and could be replaced if they terminated study participation earlier than 21 days.	Results	2
