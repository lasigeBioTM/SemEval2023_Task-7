Local Control	Results	1
following a combination of stereotactic radiosurgery and surgical resection for brain metastases; to determine the incidence of the brain injury following the combination therapy. Local control: Absence of radiographic evidence of tumor at the site of therapy constitutes local control of the treated disease.Recurrence in the treated region: The reappearance of tumor on any MRI or CT scan at the site of treatment constitutes recurrent disease at the treated region. Recurrence outside the treated region: The development of new intracranial metastatic foci or leptomeningeal disease constitutes recurrence outside the treated region. Leptomeningeal disease will be documented by a positive CSF cytology, abnormal myelogram or spinal MRI.	Results	2
