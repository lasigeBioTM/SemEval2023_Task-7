Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants With Disease-Free Survival (DFS) Events in Herceptin 1-Year Arm Compared to Observation: 1-Year Median Follow-Up	Results	1
median	BAO:0002174	123-129
DFS events included loco-regional or distant recurrence of breast cancer, development of contralateral breast cancer or second non-breast malignancy other than basal or squamous carcinoma of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or death from any cause. The percentage of participants with at least one DFS event was reported. The analysis of the Herceptin 1-Year Arm against the Observation Arm after 1-year median follow-up, as reported below, was performed by the Sponsor in 2006 following database cleaning. The analysis of the Herceptin 2-Year Arm against the Observation Arm was performed for an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) in 2005 at a time the Sponsor was blinded. Therefore, these data are reported under a separate Outcome Measure.	Results	2
