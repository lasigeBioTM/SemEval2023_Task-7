Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on Investigator Assessment.	Results	1
PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death from any cause on or prior to the data cutoff date for the statistical analysis, whichever occurred earlier. Tumor responses were assessed every 6 weeks using, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) and defined as: Complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial response (PR) occurs when at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline; Stable disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a PR nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for Progressive disease (PD); Progressive Disease- is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir.
