Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
OA/US Specificity (Downgrade (%) for BI-RADS 4A & 4B) of Benign Masses	Results	1
Outcome is the percentage of benign masses correctly downgraded by (OA/US) ultrasonography from a suspicious abnormality (4A or 4B) to benign or probably benign (BI-RADS 2 or 3). BI-RADS is the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System established the American College of Radiology. BI-RADS scores range from 0 to 6, with increase in score indicating an increase in the probability of malignancy. A BI-RADS score of 4 or more indicates the need for biopsy. Specificity is reported with a 96% confidence interval using a normal approximation.	Results	2
