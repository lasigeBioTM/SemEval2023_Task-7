Dasatinib 100 mg BID	Intervention	1
Participants were administered an oral dose of 100 mg dasatinib tablet twice daily for a total daily dose (TDD) of 200 mg. Study treatment continued for as long as it was tolerated, or until progressive disease (PD), defined as appearance of new lesion/s, or >=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, relative to the smallest sum LD recorded since treatment start, or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.

Number of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)	Results	1
Tumor response was defined as the number of participants whose best response was CR or PR, per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST): CR: disappearance of all target/non-target lesions; PR: >= 30% decrease in the sum of the LDs of target lesions relative to the baseline sum LD.
