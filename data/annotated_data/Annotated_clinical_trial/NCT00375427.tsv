Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Annual Overall Skeletal Morbidity Rate (SMR)	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	34-38
The SMR was computed by summing all Skeletal Related Event(s) (SREs)which occurred during the observation period and dividing it by the ratio "days of observation period / 365.25", for each participant. SRE was defined as: pathologic bone fracture, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone both curative and prophylactic, radiation therapy to bone, or hypercalcemia of malignancy.	Results	2

surgery	OAE:0000067	274-281
hypercalcemia	HP:0003072,DOID:12678	352-365
SMR (years) = 365.25 x SMR(days) where SMR (days) = total number of SREs / total SRE risk period (days). Risk period for SMR was computed as the days from randomization date to the date of last visit.	Results	3
