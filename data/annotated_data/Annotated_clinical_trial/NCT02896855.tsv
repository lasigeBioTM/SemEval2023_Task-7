Arm A: Placebo + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel	Intervention	1
Placebo matched to pertuzumab, trastuzumab (8-milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg] loading dose for Cycle 1, followed by 6 mg/kg for subsequent cycles), and docetaxel (75-milligrams per square meter [mg/m^2]) were administered by intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Following the primary analysis and upon approval of protocol version 4 (07-March-2020), the treatment assignment of participants in Arm A who were still on study treatment was unblinded, allowing the investigators to present those participants with the option to cross over and receive pertuzumab (in place of placebo) in addition to trastuzumab and docetaxel.

Progression-Free Survival, as Determined by the Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)	Results	1
Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to first occurrence of progressive disease (PD), as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause within 18 weeks after the last tumor assessment, whichever occurred first. As per RECIST v1.1, PD is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, an increase in size of measurable lesions by at least 5 millimeters (mm), and the appearance of new lesions. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate median PFS for each treatment arm. Data for participants who did not have a PFS event were censored at the time of the last tumor assessment (if no tumor assessments performed after baseline, at randomization plus 1 day).	Results	2
