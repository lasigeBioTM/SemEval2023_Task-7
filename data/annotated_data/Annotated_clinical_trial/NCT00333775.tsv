Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression-free Survival	Results	1
Progression-free survival was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0). Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the time of the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Disease progression was defined as  20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or appearance of new lesion(s).
