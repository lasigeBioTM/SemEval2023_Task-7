Percentage of Patients With Pathological Complete Response (pCR) in Patients Who Have Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) Expression	Results	1
fatty acid	CHEBI:35366	86-96
pCR is defined as no invasive disease in the breast of axilla at the time of definitive surgery. A patient is considered to have FASN expression if the positivity was >= 15% at the baseline or after 4-7 days of Omeprazole monotherapy. FASN expression is evaluated using immunohistochemistry in core biopsy samples. The percent of patients with FASN expression that have pCR will be calculated with an exact 95% confidence interval.
