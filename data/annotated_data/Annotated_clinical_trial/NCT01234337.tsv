Sorafenib tablets were administered orally continuously at a total daily dose of 600 mg (200 mg in the morning, 400 mg in the evening) in a 3-week cycle. Capecitabine was administered orally at a total daily dose of 2,000 mg/m^2 (1,000 mg/m^2 twice daily, 12 hours apart). If tolerability criteria were met for a participant, capecitabine dose was escalated to 2,500 mg/m^2 total daily dose (1,250 mg/m^2 twice daily) and sorafenib dose to a total daily dose of 800 mg for that participant.

Progression-free Survival (PFS) Assessed by the Independent Review Panel According to Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1	Results	1
PFS was defined as the time from date of randomization to disease progression, radiological or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST version 1.1, progressive disease was determined when there was at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that was the smallest sum on trial). In addition to a relative increase of 20%, the sum had demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Appearance of new lesions and unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions was also interpreted as progressive disease. Participants without progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of evaluable tumor evaluation. Median and other 95% confidence intervals (CIs) computed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.	Results	2

Arm/Group Description: Sorafenib tablets were administered orally continuously at a total daily dose of 600 mg (200 mg in the morning, 400 mg in the evening) in a 3-week cycle. Capecitabine was administered orally at a total daily dose of 2,000 mg/m^2 (1,000 mg/m^2 twice daily, 12 hours apart). If tolerability criteria were met for a participant, capecitabine dose was escalated to 2,500 mg/m^2 total daily dose (1,250 mg/m^2 twice daily) and sorafenib dose to a total daily dose of 800 mg for that participant.
