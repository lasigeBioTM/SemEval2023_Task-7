Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Overall Tumor Response	Results	1
Tumor response was measured as the number of participants achieving either a complete response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR; 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions) among all participants who received study treatment. Tumor response was evaluated as the best response in accordance with response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). Progressive disease: a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Stable disease: small changes that do not meet the above-mentioned criteria.	Results	2
