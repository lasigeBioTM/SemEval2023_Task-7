The Lee Fatigue Scale	Results	1
fatigue	HP:0012378	8-15
The Lee Fatigue Scale consists of 18 items related to fatigue and energy: 13 items in the fatigue subscale and 5 items in the energy subscale. The mean of the 13 items in the fatigue subscale (range from 0-10) and the mean of the 5 items in the energy subscale (range from 0-10) are calculated. Higher scores indicate higher levels of perceived fatigue and energy . Items in the energy subscale were recoded, and a Lee fatigue total score was calculated as the average of all 18 items (ranging between 0 and 10), higher scores indicating higher levels of fatigue.
