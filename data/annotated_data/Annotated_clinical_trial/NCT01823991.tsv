Change in Cognitive Function Scores With Intervention - HVLT and COWA	Results	1
function	BAO:0003117,BFO:0000034	20-28
Mean change in cognitive function scores measured from baseline to post intervention with Cognutrin compared to placebo. Mean cognitive function scores by group and compared by time of testing (Time 1, Time 2). The HVLT test assesses verbal learning and memory. Subjects are given a list of words and asked to repeat as many words as they can recall at 3 times. There is no absolute low & high, as scores are age adjusted. Reported scores are T-scores- average score should be 50, with a standard deviation of 10. Any score below 50 indicates performance below population averages and any score above 50 indicates higher than population averages.The COWA test is a verbal fluency test that measures spontaneous production of words belonging to the same category or beginning with a designed letter. The scores are converted to z-scores. A Z score of -1 is 1 standard deviation below mean. The lowest and highest Z scores could be  -3.0 and 3.0. A lower Z score is indicative of poor fluency.
