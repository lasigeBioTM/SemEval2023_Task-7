Patients with denuded mucosa caused by GVHD are eligible for enrollment, regardless of prior treatment for acute GVHD; denuded mucosa is defined as loss (i.e., erosion or sloughing) of the epithelium in: a) at least one-third of the surface area in a 30 cm colonic segment (i.e., rectosigmoid, descending or transverse colon); or b) at least one fifth of the surface area of the second portion of the duodenum, as estimated by endoscopic evaluation; denuded mucosa must be documented by images of the duodenum and colon and by histologic evaluation of the colon	Eligibility	2

Functional Recovery	Results	1
functional	BAO:0000010	0-10
Functional recovery was defined as partial or complete resolution of gastrointestinal manifestations of acute graft-versus-host disease. Gastrointestinal manifestations of acute graft-versus-host disease include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and bleeding. Complete response (CR) of intestinal GVHD was defined as the absence of any symptoms referable to intestinal GVHD. Partial response (PR) was defined as clearing of abdominal pain (or withdrawal of opioid analgesic requirements in patients treated for abdominal pain) and of grossly visible bleeding if present, and resolution of diarrhea or decrease in the three day average stool volume by  500 mL in patients with stool volumes of  500 mL. Progression of GVHD was defined as an increase in the three day average stool volume by > 500 mL, or the development of new abdominal pain (or new opioid analgesic requirements) or new intestinal bleeding.
