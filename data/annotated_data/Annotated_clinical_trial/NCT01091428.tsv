mtd	BAO:0001248	33-36
paclitaxel	CHEBI:45863	108-118
The MTD is defined as the dose range at which  1 of 6 evaluable participants experience dose limiting toxicities (DLT). DLT was evaluated according to National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.02 and was defined as any of the following events: 1. Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia lasting 7 consecutive days; 2. Grade 4 neutropenia with fever and/or infection; 3. Platelet count <10,000/mm^3; 4. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; 5. Any other Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity, with following exceptions: Grade 3 nausea/emesis, Grade 3 diarrhoea, Grade 3 fatigue, Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity that could be controlled to Grade 2 with appropriate treatment; 6. Other alisertib-related nonhematologic toxicities Grade 2 that, in opinion of investigator, required a dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy with alisertib.	Results	2
