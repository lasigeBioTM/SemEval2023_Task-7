Hydrophor (Group A)	Intervention	1
group	CHEBI:24433	11-16
Group A (current standard of care): Patients will be instructed (by nurses and with printed study materials) to apply a thin layer of the Hydrophor daily, starting at the onset of radiation therapy (RT) and continuing until 2 weeks after the final RT session or until the RT site is healed (whichever is first). Hydrophor application should include the entire treatment area, including the axillae and shoulder/back area in patients treated with modified radical mastectomy. To avoid possible build-up effects, patients should not apply the Hydrophor within 4 hours of receiving RT. Patients should wash the application area daily with perfume-free soap and tap water. Patients will be asked to refrain from using other topical agents in the irradiated area.	Intervention	2

The aim of this study is to compare the effects of Medihoney and Hydrophor on radiation dermatitis reactions in a group of women undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer. It is hoped that the outcome of this pilot study will provide evidence supporting the use of Medihoney in preventing and treating radiation dermatitis as well as sufficient preliminary data to expand this study to larger, federally funded research (R01) looking at the beneficial aspects of Medihoney across a spectrum of radiation dermatitis and mucositis in several disease settings.
