Inclusion Criteria:	Eligibility	0
Patients with inflammatory (stage IIIb) or responsive stage IV breast cancer with metastasis to soft tissue and/or bone; responsive stage IV disease is defined as patients who achieve a PR (>= 50% reduction in measurable tumor burden) or CR following initial chemotherapy for metastatic disease or patients with locally recurrent disease (chest wall/axillary nodes) who are rendered disease-free following surgery or radiation therapy without receiving chemotherapy; bone disease is categorized as responsive if there is demonstrated sclerosis of prior lesions with no new lesions	Eligibility	1
