Carboplatin, ABI-007 and Bevacizumab	Intervention	1
carboplatin	CHEBI:31355	0-11
Participants received combination carboplatin, ABI-007 (i.e., a nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel also called Abraxane), and bevacizumab (Avastin). Bevacizumab was administered as 15 mg/kg on days 1, 22, and 43 for patients without hematologic toxicity. For those with hematologic toxicity, bevacizumab was administered as 10mg/kg on day 1 and 15. Similarly, for patients without hematologic toxicity, a standard carboplatin dose according to the participant's area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC-6) was administered on days 1, 22, and 43. For patients with a hematologic toxicity, carboplatin was only given on day 1. Finally, for those without hematologic toxicity, ABI-007 (Abraxane) 100mg/m2 was administered on days 1,8, 15, 22, 29, 36,43,and 50. Conversely, for patients with hematologic toxicity, Abraxane was administered as 100mg/m2 only on days 1, 8, and 15.	Intervention	2

Progression-free Survival	Results	1
Progression-free survival was measured from treatment initiation to 30 months. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.
