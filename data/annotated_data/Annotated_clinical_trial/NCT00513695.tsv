Treatment (Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Before Surgery)	Intervention	1
surgery	OAE:0000067	43-50
Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising sunitinib malate PO once daily and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 8-12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning within 3 weeks of completion of sunitinib malate and paclitaxel, patients receive doxorubicin IV once weekly for 15 weeks, cyclophosphamide PO once daily for 15 weeks, and filgrastim SC on days 2-7 for 16 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 3-6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo surgery.	Intervention	2
