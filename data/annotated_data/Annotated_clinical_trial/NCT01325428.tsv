Part A: Clinical Benefit (CB) Assessed by Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) for at Least 6 Months Using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1).	Results	1
stable	HP:0031915	91-97
disease	DOID:4,OGMS:0000031	98-105
Tumour response was assessed separately for Part A and Part B according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The primary endpoint of this study was confirmed clinical benefit, as assessed by Stable Disease (SD) for at least 6 months (defined as >182 days), Partial Response (PR), or Complete Response (CR) according to RECIST version 1.1 (only confirmed responses were considered).

Time frame: This endpoint was assessed between the from first administration of trial medication in Part A and the earliest of PD, death or start of next treatment (either Part B combination therapy or new anti-cancer therapy) up to 929 days.	Results	3
