Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve Extrapolated to Infinity (AUCinf) of Trastuzumab	Results	1
area	PATO:0001323	0-4
AUCinf represents the area under the concentration-time curve of trastuzumab in serum over the time interval from 0 extrapolated to infinity. Values for AUCinf of trastuzumab were derived by non-compartmental analysis across all pharmacokinetic (PK) collections and expressed in days by micrograms per milliliter (daysμg/mL).	Results	2
