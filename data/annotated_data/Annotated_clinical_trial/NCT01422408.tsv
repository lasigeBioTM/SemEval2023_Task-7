vaginal dryness	HP:0031088	28-43
Change in symptom scores of vaginal dryness, itching, and dyspareunia will be evaluated by the Mayo/North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) patient questionnaire which has patients grade how much vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, and vaginal discomfort during intercourse they are currently experiencing on an ordinal scale of zero to four (none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively). Analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test with 2.5% significance level to account for two co-primary endpoints.	Results	2
