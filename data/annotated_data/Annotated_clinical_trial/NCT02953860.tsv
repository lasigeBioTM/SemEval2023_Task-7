fulvestrant	CHEBI:31638	58-69
To determine the clinical benefit rate at 24 weeks of the combination of enzalutamide/fulvestrant. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan or by caliper. Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), >=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR; clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 24 weeks (CR + PR + stable disease lasting at least 24 weeks.
