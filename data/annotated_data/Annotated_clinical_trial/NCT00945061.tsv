Patients with multicentric carcinoma (tumors in different quadrants of the breast or tumors separated by at least 4 cm).

Extensive intraductal component (EIC) by the Harvard definition, i.e. 1) more than 25% of the invasive tumor is Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and DCIS present in adjacent breast tissue. Presence of an EIC increases the chance of local recurrence, and as such, one might not be a candidate for repeat breast conservation.	Eligibility	11
