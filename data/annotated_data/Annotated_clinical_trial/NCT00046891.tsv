Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
The Level of Cognitive Dysfunction as Measured by the High Sensitivity Cognitive Screen (HSCS) Overall Score.	Results	1
The primary analysis involved compiling each subscale score for the HSCS into area under the curve (AUC) scores for the data points from baseline to the 12 month data point. HSCS instrument contains questions regarding Memory (0-39), Language (0-30), Visual-motor (0-10), Spatial (0-8), Attention and Concentration (0-25), Self-Regulation and Planning (0-6) on a varying scales. Total is calculated by summing afore mentioned subscales, values of Total ranged from 0 to 125. Lower scores are better.	Results	2
