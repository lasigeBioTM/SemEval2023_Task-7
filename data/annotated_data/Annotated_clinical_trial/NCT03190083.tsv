3-dimensional Tomosynthesis Mammogram	Intervention	1
The patients assigned a Breast imaging-reporting and data system (BIRADS) 5 category at the time of diagnosis and all new diagnosed breast cancer patients, will undergo a separate 2-D plus DBT in addition to the standard 2-D mammogram	Intervention	2

2-dimensional mammogram: This is standard of care for breast cancer diagnosis. The new breast cancer patients will be scheduled for the mammogram after diagnosis at the time of surgical appointment. The radiologist reviewing the tomosynthesis images will be separate and blinded from the radiologist who reviewed the initial 2-D mammogram.	Intervention	3

digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT): The radiation dose from this/these procedure(s) will be no more than 0.4mSv for a bi-lateral breast tomosynthesis. The new breast cancer patients will be scheduled for the mammogram after diagnosis at the time of surgical appointment. The radiologist reviewing the tomosynthesis images will be separate and blinded from the radiologist who reviewed the initial 2-D mammogram.	Intervention	4
