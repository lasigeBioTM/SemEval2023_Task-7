SUNITINIB+CAPECITABINE	Intervention	1
Sunitinib was administered orally from Day 1 at the starting dose of 37.5 mg/day on a continuous daily dosing schedule in 21-day cycles. Capecitabine was administered orally from Days 1 to 14 every 21 days at a starting dose of 2,000 mg/m^2/day. Participants were monitored for toxicity, and sunitinib and/or capecitabine dosing could be interrupted or reduced according to individual tolerance. Participants with progressive disease (PD) or intolerable toxicity were considered for discontinuation from the study.	Intervention	2

Number of Participants With Objective Response Based on Data Review Committee's Assessment	Results	1
Number of participants with objective response based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0 (RECIST). CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR is defined as 30% decrease in sum of the longest dimensions (LDs) of the target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD according to RECIST. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat evaluation 4 weeks after initial documentation of response.	Results	2
