Multi-Beam Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy: IMRT with multiple beams will be utilized to treat the breast or chest wall and axillary, supraclavicular and internal mammary lymph nodes. Treatment will be delivered once a day, 5 days a week for approximately 5 weeks. All missed radiation treatment visits will be made up. Daily set-up error will be checked prior to the delivery of every treatment.	Intervention	3

The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of utilizing multi-beam IMRT in the adjuvant treatment of the breast and regional lymph nodes of women with node-positive breast cancer requiring coverage of the internal mammary lymph nodes. A feasibility rate of at least 90% is required, ie, treatment can be successfully planned and delivered for at least 90% of the patients.	Results	2
