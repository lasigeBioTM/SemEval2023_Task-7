Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Proportion of Confirmed Tumor Responses (Complete or Partial Response)	Results	1
The proportion of confirmed responses will be estimated by the number of women who achieve a CR or PR on two consecutive evaluations at least 6-8 weeks apart depending on the dose level. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients at each dose level. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion at each dose level will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner. Response will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1); Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to <1.0 cm. and normalization of tumor biomarkers. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of the non-nodal target lesions and the short axis of the target lymph nodes taking as reference the Baseline Sum of Diameters.
