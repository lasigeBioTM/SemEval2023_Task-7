Average Area Under the Curve (AUC) per assessment (aAUCpa) of average pain (item 3 on the Daily Post-Paclitaxel Questionnaire; "Please rate the same aches/pain by circling the ONE number that best describes your aches/pains on the AVERAGE in the last 24 hours.") over 12 weeks. Scores are reported on a 0-100 scale, where 100=better outcome quality of life (QOL). The aAUCpa is the average of each AUC between each sequential assessment from treatment-initiation to the week-12 assessment.	Results	2
