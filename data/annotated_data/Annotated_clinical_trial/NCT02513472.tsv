ORR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using independent imaging review (IIR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. BOR of CR and PR was confirmed by a subsequent CR assessment and CR or PR assessment, respectively at least 4 weeks later. CR: disappearance of all measurable, non-measurable lesions and no unequivocal new lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) had to be reduced in short axis to less than (<) 10 millimeter (mm). PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD and there are no unequivocal new lesions, and no progression of non-target disease. The 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated by Clopper-Pearson method. As planned, data up to the primary completion date only were analyzed.	Results	2
