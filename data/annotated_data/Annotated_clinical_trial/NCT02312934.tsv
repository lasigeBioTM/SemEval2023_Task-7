Transdermal Nicotine	Intervention	1
nicotine	CHEBI:18723	12-20
Nicotine will be delivered by a transdermal patch delivery system for topical application. Each patch will contain approximately 1.75mg nicotine/cm2, and releases 7, and 14mg of nicotine, respectively, over 24 hours. Patches will be applied for 16 hours per day. Participants will be titrated over the course of the 6-week treatment period in order to avoid initial side effects as follows:	Intervention	2

Transdermal nicotine: Nicotine patches are currently FDA approved for smoking cessation. Nicotine has effects that have been well studied for many years. Studies have shown that nicotine by itself does not appear by itself to be cancer causing. The use of the nicotine patch is not expected to increase risk of breast cancer recurrence.	Intervention	4

This instrument has been used to monitor change in CRCI subjective complaints in previous studies and demonstrates good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and discriminant and convergent validity. Specifically, the PCI subscale was used as the primary outcome measure.	Results	3
instrument	BAO:0003118	5-15
The FACT-Cog PCI consists of 20 items and has a minimum score of 0 and total possible score of 72. Higher scores indicate better cognitive functioning.	Results	4
The PCI evaluates memory, concentration, mental acuity, verbal fluency, functional interference, and multitasking ability.	Results	5
