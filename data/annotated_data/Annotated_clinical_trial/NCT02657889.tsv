Any treatment-related hematologic toxicity specifically defined as: - Thrombocytopenia Grade 4 for  7 days, or Grade 3 or 4 associated with bleeding or requiring platelet transfusion; - Neutropenia Grade 4 for  7 days, or Grade 3 or 4 associated with infection or febrile neutropenia; - Anemia Grade 4, or Grade 3 or 4 requiring blood transfusion. Any treatment-related AE leading to niraparib dose interruption per the following criteria: - A dose interruption for a non-DLT lab abnormality lasting  14 days. - A dose in interruption per dose modification rules for nonhematologic AE leading to < 80% of an intended dose being administered.
