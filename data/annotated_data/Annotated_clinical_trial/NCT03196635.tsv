Number of Subjects With Acceptable Overall Clinical Image Quality for Patient-assisted (PA) and Technologist-controlled (TC) Image Sets	Results	1
quality	BAO:0002928,BFO:0000019	58-65
One PA image set and one TC image set was acquired from each completed subject. The overall clinical image quality acceptability was collected and summarized on a per subject-basis using binary responses of either acceptable or unacceptable for unilateral, two-view PA and TC compression image sets. Two readers evaluated each of the 60 image sets (30 PA and 30 TC compression image sets from 30 completed participants). In cases of disagreement between Readers 1 and 2, a third reader provided adjudication.	Results	2
