volume	PATO:0000918	31-37
Change in size of Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS) for participants on hormonal therapy, as determined by mammography are determined by (1) largest diameter of tumor, as visualized on mammography (2) extent of disease on mammography (3) quantification of mammographically-detected change from baseline to 6-month and used to generate the change in tumor volume of mammographic extent of disease from baseline. Since values were not normally distributed, the median change was calculated, and Wilcoxon sign rank tests were used to evaluate the significance of these changes	Results	2
