Sirolimus and Trastuzumab	Intervention	1
sirolimus	CHEBI:9168	0-9
Patients received oral sirolimus 6 mg daily in combination with weekly trastuzumab administered intravenously with a loading dose of 4 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg weekly in a 28-day cycle. A subsequent amendment allowed trastuzumab to be administered every 3 weeks for patient convenience, with a loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by a 6 mg/kg in a 21-day cycle. Sirolimus was administered at a 6 mg oral daily dose. Cycles were repeated on an every 21 or 28-day schedule until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the development of any of the criteria for study removal. Doses were reduced or discontinued based on tolerability.	Intervention	2
