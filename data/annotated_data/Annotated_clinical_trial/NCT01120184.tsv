Trastuzumab + Taxane	Intervention	1
taxane	CHEBI:36064	14-20
Participants received trastuzumab plus either docetaxel or paclitaxel. The regimen was chosen at the investigator's discretion. Option 1: trastuzumab 8 mg/kg via IV infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1, then 6 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each subsequent 3-week cycle; plus a minimum of 6 cycles with docetaxel 75 or 100 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Option 2: trastuzumab 4 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of Cycle 1, then 2 mg/kg IV weekly beginning on Day 8 of Cycle 1; plus a minimum of 18 weeks with paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 IV weekly. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study termination. If trastuzumab or docetaxel were discontinued for toxicity, the other agent could be continued as monotherapy.	Intervention	2

Participants received trastuzumab emtansine plus pertuzumab-placebo. Trastuzumab emtansine was administered as 3.6 mg/kg via IV infusion, following completion of the placebo IV infusion, on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study termination.	Intervention	5

death	OAE:0000632	32-37
disease	DOID:4,OGMS:0000031	41-48
Tumor assessments were performed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, using radiographic images submitted to the IRF up to and including the confirmatory tumor assessment 4 to 6 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Disease progression was defined as a greater than or equal to (  ) 20 percent (%) and 5-millimeter (mm) increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum obtained during the study, or appearance of new lesion(s). The percentage of participants with death or disease progression was calculated as [number of participants with event divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.	Results	2
