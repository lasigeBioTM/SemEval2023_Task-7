Objective Response Rate (ORR)	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	19-23
Among participants with CR or PR as the best overall response, duration of response (DOR) was defined as the time from which measurement criteria were met for CR or PR until the date of progression. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from study enrollment to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. PFS data were censored at the time of removal from study. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from study registration to death from any cause. Information on vital status was collected following study completion through July 23, 2018 and was used in the determination of OS. Among patients with SD as the best overall response, duration of SD was defined as the time from study enrollment to disease progression or removal from study.	Results	2
