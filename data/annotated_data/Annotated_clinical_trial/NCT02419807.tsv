Diagnostic (Indocyanine Green, 99mTc-labeled Radiotracer)	Intervention	1
indocyanine green	CHEBI:31696	12-29
Participants receive technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid injection and undergo lymphoscintigraphy according to clinical practice. Prior to surgery, participants also receive indocyanine green solution subdermally close to the tumor or into subareolar region of the breast skin. Participants then undergo Axillary Lymph Node Biopsy and surgery.	Intervention	2

Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Proportion of Sentinel Lymph Nodes (SLNs) Flagged by the Two Methods	Results	1
lymph	UBERON:0002391	23-28
Let A be the number of Tc-positive and ICG-positive sentinel nodes (SNs) detected, B be the number of Tc-positive and ICG-negative SNs detected, and C be the number of Tc-negative and ICG-positive SNs detected. The total number (N) of SNs detected is therefore N = (A + B + C); the proportion of SNs detected by the Tc method (PTc) is (A + B)/N; and the proportion of SNs detected by the ICG method (PICG) is (A + C)/N. Differences in the proportions of SLNs flagged will be compared using a two-sided 95% confidence interval.	Results	2
