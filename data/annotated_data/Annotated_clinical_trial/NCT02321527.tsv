Following the Microbubble CEUS of ipsilateral axillary nodes, needle biopsy and I-125 seed placement, a single node/participant (biopsied node) will be included in the statistical evaluation. The technique determined as technically feasible if an enhancing node is visualized in at least 90% of the subjects and 80% concordance is achieved between imaging-guided biopsy and final surgical histopathology. If no enhancement is identified, the overlying skin will be massaged, and re-injection of contrast will be employed up to three times. If no contrast enhancement in lymphatics is observed, the case will be reported as a failure of the CEUS technique.	Results	2
