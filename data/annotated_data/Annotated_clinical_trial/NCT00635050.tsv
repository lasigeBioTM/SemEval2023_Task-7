rate	BAO:0080019	0-4
Results of the pathologic evaluation of the surgical specimen(s) from operation (segmental or total mastectomy) will be used to report the overall complete pathological response rate. Criteria used were those described by Kaufmann et al, Journal of Clinical Oncology 2003; 21(13):2600-2608. The definition of pCR used from this source was absence of invasive cancer in both resected breast tissue and in resected axillary nodes.	Results	2
