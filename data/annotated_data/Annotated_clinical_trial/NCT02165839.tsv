The effects of the Brief Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (BBT-I) intervention on insomnia will be measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The ISI survey questionnaire is a 7-question survey, with each question having 5 possible answers (none, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe), scored as 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively. The full range of ISI scores is from 0 to 28. Lower scores are considered good, better, or healthy, and increasingly higher scores are considered to indicate greater insomnia. Clinical interpretation is as follows:	Results	2
