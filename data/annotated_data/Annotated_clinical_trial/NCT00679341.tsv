Progression-free Survival (PFS) by the Investigator Using Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)	Results	1
PFS was defined as the time from randomization (R) to first documented investigator-assessed radiographic or clinical disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. For target lesions (TL), PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of TLs, taking as reference the SLD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-TLs, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Data for patients without PD or death were censored at the last date of tumor assessment prior to crossover (or, if no tumor assessment was performed after Baseline, at the R date +1 day). Data for patients who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last date of tumor assessment prior to crossover at which the patient was known to be progression free. Data for patients with no post-baseline tumor assessment were censored at the R date +1 day.	Results	2
