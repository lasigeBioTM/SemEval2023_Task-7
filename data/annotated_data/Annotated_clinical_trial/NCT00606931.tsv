breast	UBERON:0000310	91-97
Individuals with suspected tumor size measuring one cm or less on mammography and/or ultrasound and/or MRI if the lesion is visible on any of these modalities, except that each site may enroll up to three patients each where the lesion of interest as measured on mammography (or ultrasound and/or MRI if not detectable on mammography) is more than 1 cm. (Note: The study will target patient enrollment such that at least 50% of the lesions to undergo biopsy across all sites will be less than 1 cm in diameter as measured on mammography, or as measured by other modalities, such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI, if the lesion is not detectable or measurable on mammography.)
