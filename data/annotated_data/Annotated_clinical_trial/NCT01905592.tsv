Progression Free Survival (PFS) - Central Review Assessment	Results	1
central	HP:0030645	34-41
The primary objective of this study is to compare progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by blinded central review, of patients with advanced/metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative gBRCAmut breast cancer when treated with niraparib as compared to those treated with physician's choice single agent chemotherapy standards (eribulin, vinorelbine, gemcitabine or capecitabine). PFS is defined as the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier as per Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 as determined by central review assessment.
