Numerical Change From Baseline in Hot Flash Score at Treatment Week 6 (Positive Numbers to Represent Increases and Negative Numbers to Represent Decreases).	Results	1
week	UO:0000034	63-67
Hot flash activity will be analyzed in a number of ways. For the primary analysis, the numerical change-from-baseline to hot flash score after week 6 of treatment will be compared between the highest dose treatment arm and the placebo arm. A hot flash score is computed for each patient by assigning points (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=very severe) to each hot flash based on patient-reported severity, adding the points for each day, and averaging across each week of the study. Abbreviations for the analysis population description: Eligible patients (EPs). Evaluable for primary (EFP). Off-study for adverse event (AE). Do not have 6 weeks of data (NODATA).	Results	2
