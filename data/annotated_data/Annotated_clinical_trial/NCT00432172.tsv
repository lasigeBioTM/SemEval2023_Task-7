Pathological Response for Basal Group 2	Results	1
group	CHEBI:24433	32-37
This primary outcome only applies for the basal group 2 as per protocol. The pathological response in luminal group 1 was not pre-specified even as a Secondary Outcome. Pathological response was assessed after surgery, according to the Miller & Payne criteria, which stratifies the responses based on the proportion of remaining tumor and post-chemotherapy changes, evaluating separately the response in breast and axilla. Grades 1-4 are categorised as a partial pathological response (pPR) and grade 5 was a complete pathological response (cPR).	Results	2
