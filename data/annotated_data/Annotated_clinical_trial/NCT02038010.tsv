Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of Dose-escalating BYL719 in Combination With T-DM1	Results	1
DLTs of BYL719 in combination with T-DM1 will be assessed using National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria for adverse events version 4.0 (except for hyperglycemia). A DLT is described any grade 3 or higher, clinically significant toxicity (excluding alopecia) experienced during the first 21 days following first dose of BYL719 that is determined to be at least possibly related to study medication. Lower grades may also be considered DLTs if they lead to a dose interruption of more than 7 consecutive days of BYL719. In general adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the following:	Results	2
