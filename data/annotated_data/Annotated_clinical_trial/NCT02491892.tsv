Percentage of Participants Achieving a Best Overall Response of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)	Results	1
Objective tumor response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and confirmed PR was defined as at least at 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions. Response was to be confirmed at follow-up assessment completed within 4 weeks of the first documented response. The percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of CR or PR was calculated as [number of participants meeting the above criteria divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.
