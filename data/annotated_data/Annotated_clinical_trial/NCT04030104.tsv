Gain in Specificity at Fixed 98% Sensitivity (fSp)	Results	1
Primary effectiveness endpoint was the difference (gain) in specificity (fSp) at fixed 98% sensitivity for the Imagio IUS+OA relative to IUS alone, across all 15 independent readers; both imaging modalities used in each subject (subject as own control); results for each imaging modality compared to biopsy diagnosis or 12-month follow-up ruling of benign as determined by truth panel (ground truth). fSp derived from empirical receiver operating characteristic (ROC) using endpoint interpolation.
