Number of events (disease relapse or death) to time of observation for DFS. DFS defined as time from randomization to earliest documentation of disease relapse or death from any cause in postmenopausal, receptor positive, node negative or node positive breast cancer patients for adjuvant treatment with exemestane compared with adjuvant tamoxifen therapy at 2.75 years.
