bone marrow	UBERON:0002371	58-69
Pathological or radiographically confirmation of metastases to the bone and/or bone marrow. (The definition of radiologic diagnosis of bone metastasis is based on typical and highly reliable imaging findings in studies such as bone scan (new or multiple TC99m positive lesions), PET/CT (new or multiple FRG positive lesions), and MRI (typical T1w replacement, T2w positive and T1 plus contrast media positive) for bone metastasis with 2 or more lesions. If the bone metastasis is highly suspected or not well defined by imaging, bone biopsy is necessary for confirmation.)	Eligibility	2
