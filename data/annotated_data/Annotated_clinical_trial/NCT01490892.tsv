breast cancer	DOID:1612	10-23
Characterization of benign and malignant breast cancer lesions is compared by each imaging method which evaluates vascular activity. Imaging methods to be compared are 3D Subharmonic imaging (SHI) or pulse inversion harmonic imaging (HI), fundamental grayscale ultrasound (US) or power Doppler imaging (PDI). Data will be analyzed qualitatively.	Results	2
