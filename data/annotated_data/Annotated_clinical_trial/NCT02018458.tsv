Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 . This will include all patients (eligible and ineligible) who receive at least 1 inoculation of DC vaccine therapy. This safety population will also be used for the summaries and analysis of all safety parameters (drug exposure, tables of adverse events information, including serious adverse events, etc.).
