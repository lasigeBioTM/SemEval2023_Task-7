doxorubicin	CHEBI:28748,BAO:0000639	0-11
cyclophosphamide	CHEBI:4026	14-30
Patients received doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2), both in a short intravenous infusion, every three weeks for four cycles (days 1, 22, 43 and 64). Three weeks later, docetaxel (36 mg/m2) was administered as a 30-min intravenous infusion, weekly for six weeks (days 85, 92, 99, 106, 113 and 120) followed by a 2-week resting period (8-week cycle). After that, patients received a second docetaxel cycle (infusions on days 141, 148, 155, 162, 169 and 176).	Intervention	2

Pathological Complete Response (pCR) Rate	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	37-41
Pathological complete response was defined by the Miller & Payne criteria. pCR was defined as no invasive cells identifiable in breast sections at surgery. Response was measured by physical exam and breast imaging before surgery and was evaluated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Pathological response after surgery, was based on the proportion of remaining tumor and postchemotherapy changes, evaluating separately the response in the breast and in the axilla lymph nodes.
