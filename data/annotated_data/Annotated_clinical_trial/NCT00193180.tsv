All patients in this study received docetaxel 30 mg/m2 weekly for 3 consecutive weeks of each 28-day cycle, along with continuous imatinib mesylate. Initially, imatinib mesylate was given at a dose of 600 mg orally daily, beginning concurrently with the first dose of docetaxel; however, after the first 15 patients were treated it became evident that this imatinib dose was not tolerable, and subsequent patients received imatinib mesylate 400 mg orally daily.
