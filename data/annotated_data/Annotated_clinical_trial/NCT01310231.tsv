Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression Free Survival.	Results	1
Scans will be repeated every 9 weeks. Local follow up for survival will continue until all patients have died or for a maximum total follow up of 3 years, which ever occurs first. The two study arms will be compared in an intent to treat fashion using Cox proportional hazard analysis, with the stratification variables included in the model. Treatment discontinuation for toxicity or other reasons will be considered an event.	Results	2
Time frame: From date of randomization to first documented progression or death, which ever occurs first, assessed up to 3 years.	Results	3
