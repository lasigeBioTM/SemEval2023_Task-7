Percentage of Participants With Overall Confirmed Objective Disease Response	Results	1
disease	DOID:4,OGMS:0000031	60-67
Objective disease response =participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. A PR was defined as a > = 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions associated to a non-progressive disease response for the non target lesions.
