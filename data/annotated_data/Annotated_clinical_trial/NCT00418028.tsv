Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time (in months) from the moment the patient starts the study treatment to the date of progressive disease. That is, a patient has an event is she progresses or dies due to progressive disease. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0).	Results	2
