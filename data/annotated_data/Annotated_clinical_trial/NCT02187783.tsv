Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Number of Participants With Solid Tumor Response  16 Weeks for Based Upon Local Investigator Assessments	Results	1
Clinical benefit (CB) for patients with solid tumors were assessed using RECIST 1.1 and included responses of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) for  16 weeks. CR and PR (for solid tumors) required a confirmation at least 4 weeks after the initial response observation. For hematologic tumors other appropriate hematological response criteria was applied. CR=Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had reduction in short axis to <10 mm, PR=At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters, SD=Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study, PD=At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions and also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
