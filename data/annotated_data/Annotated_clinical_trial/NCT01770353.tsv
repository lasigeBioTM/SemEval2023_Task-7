Two tumour biopsies were collected 72 hours after the first MM-398 IV infusion during Cycle 1 of the MM-398 Treatment phase of the Pilot phase for determination of tumour levels of irinotecan and SN-38 (an active metabolite). The lesions selected for biopsy were based on the results of the FMX-MRI obtained on Days 1, 2 and 4 of the FMX phase, and were collected from a previously non-biopsied lesion. The first core biopsy was taken in the region of the tumour that showed the greatest signal change on either the T2 or T1 sequences, based on FMX-MRI. The second core biopsy was taken from the region that showed the least signal change based on FMX-MRI, avoiding areas of necrosis.	Results	2
