Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Time to Tumor Progression	Results	1
time	PATO:0000165	0-4
Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target measurable lesions over the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease during therapy) using the same techniques as baseline. Unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease in the opinion of the treating physician. Appearance of any new lesion/site. Death due to disease without prior documentation of progression and without symptomatic deterioration. From date of randomization to time of first documentation of progression, symptomatic deterioration or death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive and progression free are considered at last date of contact.	Results	2
