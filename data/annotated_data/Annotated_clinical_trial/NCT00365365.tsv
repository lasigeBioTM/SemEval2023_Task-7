Cardiac Safety - Number of Participants With Grade 3-4 Clinical Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)	Results	1
congestive heart failure	HP:0001635,DOID:6000	64-88
Participants were evaluated for clinical CHF every 3 weeks during chemotherapy, every 3 months while on maintenance therapy, and every 3 months during the 2-year follow-up period. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of CHF was assessed by multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO) performed midway through completion of chemotherapy according to a treatment-specific schedule, every 12 weeks during maintenance therapy, and at 6 and 24 months after completion of maintenance therapy.
