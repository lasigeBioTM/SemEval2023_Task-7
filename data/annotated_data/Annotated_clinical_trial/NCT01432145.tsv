1st stage: If less than 3/30 evaluable patients respond at 8 weeks the trial will be stopped for futility. If 3 or more out of 30 evaluable patients respond then a further 35 patients will be recruited (2nd stage) - this was met.	Results	2
The proportion of patients responding to treatment (complete response, partial response or stable disease) at the second stage will be presented per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria version 1.1 measured radiologically with computerised tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); the same method is used at baseline and at follow-up: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Patients who yield progressive disease (PD) are classed as non-responders.	Results	3
