Number of Participants With Spot 14 Expression Pre and Post CLA as Assessed by Quantitative Immunohistochemistry and Staining Intensities Scored at 0, 1, or 2	Results	1
immunohistochemistry	BAO:0000415	92-112
To determine whether  10 days of CLA consumption suppresses Spot 14 expression in breast cancer tissue in vivo. The staining intensities scoring system used is: no immuostaining (0), weak staining (1), and strong staining (2). The scoring system used objectively and quantitatively assesses the expression of Spot 14, fatty acid synthase, and lipoprotein lipase using the image processing and analysis software Image-Pro Plusâ„¢ (MediaCybernetics).
