Participants undergo a baseline 18F-FLT-PET/CT scan followed by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan prior to chemotherapy. These scans are repeated in approximately 2 to 3 weeks, at the end of the first cycle of chemotherapy to derive a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 18F-FLT, which is calculated from the ratio of radioactivity concentration within a region of interest, and the injected dose at the time of injection, divided by body weight. The SUVmean averages the radioactivity values within a region of interest.	Results	2
