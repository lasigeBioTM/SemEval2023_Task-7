Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - Percentage of Participants With an Event	Results	1
PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of documented disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, or the date of occurrence of a second primary cancer, or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first. Participants were censored at the last tumour evaluation.	Results	2
