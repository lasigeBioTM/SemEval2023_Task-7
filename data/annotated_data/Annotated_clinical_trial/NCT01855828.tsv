Proportion of Participants With a Pathologic Complete Response Rate	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	63-67
To estimate the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) when pertuzumab is added to weekly trastuzumab/paclitaxel followed by trastuzumab/5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer. This study will assess pCR rates separately in ER+ and ER- cancers. Pathologic complete response is defined as no evidence of viable invasive tumor cells at the primary tumor site and axillary lymph nodes in the surgical specimen. Residual Disease (RD) is defined as: Any invasive cancer in the breast or axillary lymph nodes in the surgical specimen.	Results	2
