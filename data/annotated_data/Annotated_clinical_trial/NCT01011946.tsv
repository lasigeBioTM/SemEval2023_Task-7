Positron Emission Mammography	Intervention	1
positron	CHEBI:30225	0-8
Positron Emission Mammography: Patients will receive bilateral (both sides) breast and axillary PEM scans, bilateral mammography, DCE-MRI, US of the breast and axilla (the side of the affected breast), and ultrasound guided biopsy of axillary lymph node if suspicious. Various PEM views will be performed on both your breast and axilla (underarm).	Intervention	2
