MFSI-SF is a 30 item questionnaire to assess the level of fatigue in terms of general fatigue, physical fatigue, emotional fatigue, mental fatigue, and vigor). First four subscales (general, physical, emotional, and mental) are summed and the vigor scale is subtracted to create fatigue total score with a range of -32 (low fatigue) to 96 (high fatigue).
