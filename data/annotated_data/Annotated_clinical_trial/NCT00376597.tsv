Arm I (Lymphedema Education)	Intervention	1
lymphedema	HP:0001004,DOID:4977	7-17
Six weeks after surgery, patients receive a brief initial post-operative care session describing lymphedema risk and prevention through oral instruction and written materials. Patients complete physical assessments and questionnaires at 6 weeks and at 6, 12, and 18 months. Patients are also contacted by telephone at 9 and 15 months.	Intervention	2
