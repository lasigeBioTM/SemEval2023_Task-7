Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Rate	Results	1
rate	BAO:0080019	32-36
PFS was based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. PFS was defined as time in weeks from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. PFS was calculated as (first event date minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1) divided by 7. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease [PD]), or from death case report forms (CRFs). Percentage of participants who had not experienced progression or death by Week 16 is reported.	Results	2
