Participants received a single-agent chemotherapy at the discretion of the investigator according to the standard of care at the investigator's site until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, participant request for withdrawal, until the maximum cumulative dose of anthracycline was reached, or end of study (24 months after randomization of the last participant). Upon second-line disease progression participants received a single-agent chemotherapy at the discretion of the investigator according to the standard of care at the investigator's site until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, participant request for withdrawal, or end of study. Upon subsequent disease progression participants received treatment according the standard of care of the treatment site until end of study.	Intervention	2

Outcome Measurement:	Results	0
Percentage of Participants With Second-Line Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (v1.1)	Results	1
Second-line PFS was defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause during their second-line of treatment with bevacizumab and/or chemotherapy, whichever occurred first. For target lesions (TLs), PD was defined at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of the largest diameter (SLD), taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For non-target lesions (NTLs), PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. Participants without second-line PD or death were censored at the date of last tumor assessment where non-progression was documented.	Results	2
